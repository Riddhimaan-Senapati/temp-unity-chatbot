#### Q1: Could you help me with the error I am getting? (ials-gpu007: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 7: Unknown Error). There is a problem with this GPU too: (ials-gpu008: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 1: Unknown Error).

**Response:**

To address the issue you're experiencing with the error messages related to GPU handling on nodes `ials-gpu007` and `ials-gpu008`, let's analyze the information provided in the context.

The error messages indicate a problem with accessing or utilizing the GPUs on these nodes, specifically:
1. `ials-gpu007: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 7: Unknown Error`
2. `ials-gpu008: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 1: Unknown Error`

To troubleshoot this, we need to understand the configuration and status of these nodes.

From **Source 5** and **Source 6**, we can see detailed specifications of various GPU nodes on the Unity cluster. Specifically, for nodes like `gypsum-gpu[160-164,166,168,171,173-177,181,190-192]` and `ials-gpu[001-014,017-018,020-026,029-033]`, which include RTX 2080ti GPUs, we can infer that these nodes are part of the GPU-enabled infrastructure.

However, to directly address your issue, we need to identify if `ials-gpu007` and `ials-gpu008` are mentioned in the provided context with their specifications or status.

Upon reviewing the context, **Source 9** lists various GPU nodes and their configurations. Although it doesn't directly mention `ials-gpu007` or `ials-gpu008`, it provides a general overview of the GPU nodes available.

To directly solve your problem or provide a more specific answer, we would need more detailed information about the status or configuration of `ials-gpu007` and `ials-gpu008`. 

Given the information available in the context, the most appropriate step would be to check the current status of these nodes and their GPUs. You can use the command `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` as mentioned in **Source 4** to check GPU usage and availability. This might give you insights into whether the GPUs on these nodes are allocated, pending, or experiencing issues.

If the issue persists, it would be best to follow the guidelines in **Source 8** for asking for help, providing specific details about the error messages, the commands you're running, and your environment.

#### Q3: Okay, thanks for the info. I got this other error on an A100 node (gpu023) from job 34002652. The script ran fine when I added --exclude gpu023.
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52: UserWarning: CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount(). Did you run some cuda functions before calling NumCudaDevices() that might have already set an error? Error 802: system not yet initialized (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:109.)
  return torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0
...
    assert torch.cuda.is_available()
AssertionError:

**Response:**

To address the issue of a "CUDA initialization" error on Unity HPC A100 GPU nodes when using PyTorch, we need to consider the information provided in the context.

First, let's establish that the A100 GPU nodes are available and have NVLink and NVSwitch configurations, which are crucial for certain GPU-accelerated computations [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

1. **NVLink and NVSwitch Configuration**: The A100 nodes, specifically `gpu[013-024]`, have NVSwitch, allowing all GPUs to be linked at the same speed. This is relevant because PyTorch can utilize NVLink if configured correctly [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

2. **PyTorch and NVLink**: To use NVLink with PyTorch, one must specify the `nccl` backend for `torch.distributed`. This is crucial for utilizing the fast interconnect between GPUs, especially on nodes like `gpu[013-024]` that are connected with Infiniband [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

3. **Requesting Nodes**: When using the A100 nodes, it's recommended to request the entire node using `--exclusive` due to the NVLink/NVSwitch configuration. This ensures that you have control over the topology and can utilize the GPUs as needed [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

4. **CUDA and GPU Availability**: The error "CUDA initialization" suggests an issue with CUDA or GPU detection. Ensuring that CUDA is correctly loaded and that the GPU is available is crucial. The command `torch.cuda.is_available()` should return `True` if CUDA is properly set up [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Given these points, the issue seems to be related to how PyTorch is interacting with the CUDA environment on the A100 nodes. To troubleshoot:

- Ensure you're loading the correct CUDA module compatible with your PyTorch version.
- Verify that you're using the `nccl` backend for `torch.distributed` if you're utilizing multiple GPUs.
- Request the entire node using `--exclusive` when submitting your job to ensure you have full control over the GPUs and their configuration.

If the issue persists, it may be helpful to check the specific CUDA and PyTorch versions you're using and ensure they are compatible. Additionally, consulting the Unity documentation on setting up a TensorFlow or PyTorch GPU environment might provide further insights [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

To resolve the "CUDA_HOME not existing" error when utilizing a GPU in an sbatch job for models, you need to ensure that the CUDA environment is properly set up.

First, you should load the necessary CUDA module. The available CUDA versions can be listed using the command `module spider cuda` [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Once you've identified the appropriate CUDA version for your needs, you can load it using `module load cuda/<version>`. For example, if you want to use CUDA version 12.6, you would use `module load cuda/12.6` [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

After loading the CUDA module, the CUDA_HOME environment variable should be set. You can verify this by checking the value of CUDA_HOME after loading the module.

Here's an example of how you might modify your sbatch script to load the CUDA module:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1

module load cuda/12.6
# Rest of your script
```

By loading the CUDA module, you should be able to resolve the "CUDA_HOME not existing" error and successfully utilize the GPU in your sbatch job [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)[[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

To load the CUDA module in an sbatch script on Unity HPC, you can use the `module load` command followed by the version of CUDA you wish to use. 

Here's an example from Source 1 (https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4 # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192 # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1 # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00 # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out # %j = job ID
module load cuda/11.8
nvcc --version
```
In this example, `module load cuda/11.8` loads the CUDA version 11.8 module [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

You can list available CUDA versions using the `module spider cuda` command as mentioned in Source 2 (https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Make sure to check which version(s) of CUDA are compatible with the software you are using.

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

To address the question regarding "Unity HPC sbatch script best practices module load cuda," we need to consider the context provided.

1. **Understanding sbatch Scripts**: sbatch scripts are used to submit batch jobs to the Slurm job scheduler on the HPC cluster. These scripts contain parameters for the job and the commands to be executed [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

2. **Module Load CUDA**: The `module load cuda` command is used to load the CUDA module, which provides access to NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit. This is essential for running GPU-accelerated jobs on the Unity cluster [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

3. **Best Practices for sbatch Scripts**:
   - **Specifying Resources**: Clearly specify the required resources such as CPUs, memory, and GPUs.
   - **Using Partitions**: Choose the appropriate partition for your job based on its requirements and duration.
   - **Loading Modules**: Load necessary modules like CUDA for GPU jobs.


4. **Relevant Information from the Context**:
   - The context provides examples of sbatch scripts and guidelines for choosing GPU resources and partitions [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/)[[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
   - It emphasizes the importance of ensuring software is compatible with GPU acceleration before requesting GPU resources [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).


5. **Best Practices for Using `module load cuda`**:
   - Ensure that the CUDA version loaded is compatible with the software being used [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
   - The context suggests listing available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).


Given the information and focusing on the best practices for `module load cuda` in sbatch scripts on Unity HPC:

- **Loading CUDA**: It's a best practice to load the CUDA module when submitting jobs that require GPU acceleration. An example from the context is: `module load cuda/11.8` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the loaded CUDA version is compatible with your application [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Therefore, when writing sbatch scripts for Unity HPC and needing to use CUDA, it is a best practice to load the appropriate CUDA module using `module load cuda/<version>`, ensuring the version is compatible with your software requirements.

For more detailed guidance on writing sbatch scripts and using CUDA on Unity, refer to the official Unity documentation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/)[[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

To resolve the `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory` issue, you can try the following approaches based on the provided context:

1. **Reduce the batch size**: Lowering the batch size can help decrease the memory usage of your PyTorch model [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
2. **Optimize data management**: Ensure that your data loading and management are optimized to reduce memory usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
3. **Use a GPU with more VRAM**: If possible, request a GPU with more available VRAM to accommodate your model's memory requirements [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
4. **Set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`**: This can help avoid fragmentation when there's a large amount of reserved but unallocated memory [[2]](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables).


You can request a different GPU type using the `--constraint` flag in your Slurm job submission. For example, to request a GPU with more VRAM, you could use a command like `sbatch --constraint=a100` or `sbatch --constraint=rtx8000`, depending on the available GPU models on the Unity system [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

For further assistance, you can reach out to the Unity help desk or visit their community page. 

To check the available GPUs and their VRAM, you can use the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command, which provides information on the total and available VRAM for each GPU model [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

#### Q1: I was running an interactive job with srun and suddenly got these errors:
slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get usage(15): GPU is lost
slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get Compute running process count(15): GPU is lost
Not sure what that means, and I'm unable to cancel the job 30185792

**Response:**

To address the issue you're facing with the error messages related to NVML and being unable to cancel the job, let's break down the steps and information available.

The error messages you're seeing, such as `NVML: Failed to get usage(15): GPU is lost` and `NVML: Failed to get Compute running process count(15): GPU is lost`, typically indicate a problem with the GPU, often related to hardware failure or driver issues [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

To cancel a job in Slurm, you can use the `scancel` command followed by the job ID. In your case, the command would be:
```
scancel 30185792
```
If you're unable to cancel the job using `scancel`, you can try using `scontrol` to cancel it:
```
scontrol cancel job 30185792
```
However, the provided context does not directly mention using `scontrol cancel job`. Instead, it mentions modifying jobs with `scontrol modify jobid=` [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/). For canceling jobs, it references using `scancel` [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/).

If you're still having trouble canceling the job, you may want to reach out to the Unity help desk for further assistance, as they can investigate the issue more deeply.

I'm sorry, but the specific information on how to handle a job that cannot be canceled with `scancel` isn't available in the provided documents.

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

To address your issue, let's break down the information provided and the context.

You're trying to run the llama3 70b model, which requires 500G of memory on the GPU. Your job is pending for a long time, and you need to run multiple test runs in one session to troubleshoot your code.

First, let's examine how you're requesting GPU resources. According to Source 1 [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/), to request GPU resources, you can use the `--gpus` flag followed by the type and number of GPUs you need. For example, `#SBATCH --gpus=2080ti:1` requests access to 1 2080ti GPU [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).


To request a specific amount of GPU memory, you can use the `--constraint` flag with `vram` followed by the amount of VRAM required. For instance, `--constraint=vram500` or a similar specification if available [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

However, the exact syntax for requesting a specific amount of VRAM isn't directly mentioned in the provided context. Instead, it suggests using `--constraint` with specific GPU models or characteristics like `sm_70&vram12` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). You can check available GPU resources using `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` as mentioned in Source 2 [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

To potentially reduce the wait time, consider the following:
1. **Choose the Right Partition**: Ensure you're using the appropriate partition for your job. For jobs requiring less than 2 hours, using `gpu-preempt` might be beneficial [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
2. **Optimize Your Resource Request**: Requesting the minimum necessary resources can help. If your job can run on less powerful GPUs or with less VRAM, adjust your request accordingly [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).
3. **Check Available Resources**: Use `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to see the current GPU usage and availability [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).
4. **Consider Interactive Jobs**: For troubleshooting, you might prefer interactive jobs using `salloc` to get immediate feedback [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Sharing your batch script could provide more specific insights into how to optimize your job submission.

I'm sorry, but the specific information on how to directly request 500G of GPU memory isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

- Total Cost: $0.007378
- Average Tokens/Second: 4354.34

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

To check your disk usage quota, you can use the `df` (disk free) command. Here's an example of how to use it:
```
$ df -h ~
```
This command will show you the amount of free space under the quota for your home directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

The output will look something like this:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
vast2:/home      50G   29G   22G  58% ~
```
This indicates that your home directory has a quota of 50G, with 29G used and 22G available, resulting in 58% usage.

You can also use the `du` (disk usage) command to check which files are taking up space:
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This will show you the disk usage of files and directories within `~/.cache/` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

Additionally, you can use `ncdu` (ncurses disk usage) for an interactive interface to explore your directory tree:
```
$ ncdu
```
This will help you navigate through your directories and identify large files or directories [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

#### Q2: Is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

To request a storage quota increase on Unity HPC, you should first check if you can reduce your storage usage by managing your data effectively. You can use tools like `df` and `du` to check your quota usage and identify files taking up space [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

If you still need more storage, determine the type and amount of storage required using the storage expansion flowchart and descriptions provided in the Unity documentation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). You can request additional storage by emailing hpc@umass.edu. For PI group work directories and project directories, you can purchase additional storage in specific increments and intervals [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

For further assistance, you can reach out to the Unity help desk at hpc@umass.edu.

#### Q3: Whats the timeline on project space?

**Response:**

To address the question regarding the "Unity HPC project directory storage timeline and quota," we need to examine the provided context for relevant information.

According to Source 2 and Source 3, Unity provides various storage options, including `/project` directories, which are suitable for storing larger amounts of data [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)[[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). The base quota for `/project` directories varies by institution but is generally available upon request, with a common initial allocation being around 5T for some institutions like URI and UMass Dartmouth [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

Source 4 further clarifies that PI group project directories have a free tier that is allocated upon request, and additional storage can be purchased in 5T increments on 1-year intervals, up to 5 years at a time [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

Therefore, the Unity HPC project directory storage timeline can be up to 5 years at a time, with a quota that starts at around 5T and can be expanded in 5T increments.

To summarize: 
- The storage quota for `/project` directories starts with a base allocation (e.g., 5T for some institutions) and can be increased.
- The timeline for purchasing additional `/project` storage is available in 5T increments on 1-year intervals, up to 5 years at a time [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).


For the exact details on quota and timeline, it's best to refer to the specific storage documentation and contact hpc@umass.edu for requests and institution-specific information [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

To transfer large files to the Unity filesystem, you have several options available. According to the documentation, Unity OnDemand is not suitable for large file transfers. However, you can use FileZilla, Globus, or command-line tools like scp and rsync [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

For large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect, Globus is a useful option. Additionally, command-line tools like scp and rsync are good for quick work via the command line [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

It's worth noting that uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow. However, UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve speeds [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

To address your issue, let's break down the steps and information provided in the context.

You're trying to run an R script named `Modular.R` within an Apptainer container. The script is used to install necessary R packages and dependencies. You've loaded the `r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer` module and are attempting to execute the script using `Rscript`.

1. **Running Rscript directly**: When you run `Rscript /path/to/Modular.R` after loading the `r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer` module, the script executes, but it fails due to write permission issues in `/usr/...`, which is expected since `/usr` is not writable in the container [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/).

2. **Running Rscript within a .def file**: You're creating an Apptainer container using a definition file (.def). Within this file, you're trying to run `Rscript /path/to/Modular.R` during the build process. However, you're encountering a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/).

The issue here is likely due to the fact that the `Modular.R` file is not available within the container's filesystem during the build process. When you build an Apptainer container, the instructions in the .def file are executed in a separate environment. Files from the host system are not automatically available unless they are explicitly copied into the container during the build process.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that `Modular.R` is accessible within the container during the build process. You can achieve this by including a `%files` section in your .def file to copy `Modular.R` into the container before attempting to run it [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/).

Here's an example of how you might modify your .def file:

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:4.4.0

%files
/path/to/Modular.R /path/inside/container/Modular.R

%post
apt-get -y update
# Run the R script
Rscript /path/inside/container/Modular.R
```

In this example, `/path/to/Modular.R` is the path to `Modular.R` on your host system, and `/path/inside/container/Modular.R` is where you want to copy it within the container. Make sure to update these paths as necessary.

By copying `Modular.R` into the container and then running it, you should be able to successfully execute the script during the container build process.

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find more specific instructions on how to use the `%files` section or how to run R scripts within an Apptainer .def file in the provided context. However, based on the information available, the above solution should help resolve the issue you're facing.

#### Q1: Good afternoon.
I'm having this error on a batch run:
slurmstepd-uri-cpu014: error: execve(): /var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job37168102/slurm_script: Not a directory

**Response:**

To address the error you're experiencing, let's break down the information provided and the context.

The error message `slurmstepd-uri-cpu014: error: execve(): /var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job37168102/slurm_script: Not a directory` suggests that Slurm is trying to execute a file (`slurm_script`) within a specific job directory, but it's encountering an issue because the path it's trying to execute is not a directory.

1. **Understanding the Error**: The error `Not a directory` typically indicates that the system is expecting a directory but is finding something else (or nothing) at the specified path.

2. **Contextual Clues**: The file in question, `slurm_script`, is likely the batch script that you've submitted to Slurm. Slurm copies this script to its spool directory (`/var/spool/slurm/slurmd/`) when you submit a job.

3. **Potential Cause**: The issue here might be related to how the batch script is being referenced or an issue with the script itself.

Given the context and the error message, a likely cause is that there's an issue with the shebang line (`#!/bin/bash` or similar) at the top of your batch script, or the script is not properly formatted or saved.

To troubleshoot this, you can check the following:
- Ensure your batch script starts with a valid shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`, for example).
- Verify that your script is saved with Unix line endings (not Windows).
- Check for any hidden characters or incorrect formatting at the beginning of your script.

Here's a relevant part from one of the sources that might help you verify your batch script [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/):
"Create a batch script file in your preferred location. In the first line of the batch script, write the line #!/bin/bash, or whichever interpreter you need."

If you're still having trouble, it might be helpful to review your batch script and submission process to ensure everything is correctly set up.

If the issue persists, you may want to reach out for further assistance as the specific details of your script and submission are not available in the provided context. I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents.

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

To determine if you have scratch space or to apply for some, you can follow these steps.

First, check if you already have scratch space by using the `ws_list` command to view a list of your workspaces along with key information about them [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

If you don't have scratch space, you can create one using the `ws_allocate` command. The HPC Workspace tool allows you to create and manage high-performance scratch space [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

For more information on scratch space and how to manage it, you can refer to the Unity documentation on HPC Workspace [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

Additionally, the storage expansion flowchart can help you decide what type of storage you need. According to the flowchart, if you need additional storage for workflows that create temporary intermediate files, you can try Unity's scratch space: HPC Workspace [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

The base quota for scratch space is not explicitly stated, but there is a 50T soft cap, and no purchasing is necessary [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

To upload a really large .pkl file, you can use Globus, which is useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/). Alternatively, you can also consider using the command-line tools like rsync, which is suitable for recurring tasks and synchronizing files over a network [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/). It's worth noting that uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow, but UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve speeds [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

#### Q1: Hi, would it be possible for me to install this program on my work directory and any advice on how to go about it?

**Response:**

To install a program on your work directory, you should first check if you have the necessary permissions and if the program is compatible with the Unity system.

According to the provided context, the `/work` directory is a shared folder for all users in the PI group and is the primary location for running cluster jobs [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

You can install the program in your `/work` directory, but you should be aware of the storage quotas and guidelines. The base quota for `/work` directories is 1 TB, and you can request additional storage if needed [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

For specific instructions on installing the program, I would recommend checking the program's documentation or contacting your PI group for guidance. Additionally, you can reach out to the Unity help desk at hpc@umass.edu for further assistance [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].
