#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, the CUDA_HOME error you're encountering is likely related to not having the CUDA module properly loaded in your GPU job. Here's how to resolve this issue:

**Load the Required CUDA Module:**

You need to load the CUDA module in your batch script before running your GPU-enabled software. According to the documentation, you should add the following to your SBATCH script:

```bash
module load cuda/12.6
```

**Complete Example for Your Batch Script:**

Here's how your batch script should look [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1
#SBATCH --mem=16G

# Load required modules
module load cuda/12.6
# If using cuDNN as well:
module load cudnn/8.9.7.29-12-cuda12.6

# Your script here
./your_model_script
```

**Check Available CUDA Versions:**

You can check which versions of CUDA are available on Unity by running [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
```bash
module spider cuda
```

**Important Notes:**
- CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and "will typically be required to be loaded for most GPU jobs because it allows access to the NVIDIA compiler suite (nvcc, nvfortran)" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Be sure to check which version(s) of CUDA are compatible with the software you're using [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

Loading the CUDA module should set the CUDA_HOME environment variable properly and resolve your error.

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

Based on the error you're experiencing, this is a common GPU out-of-memory issue. According to the documentation, "Out of Memory: (ex. CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY, torch.cuda.OutOfMemory) means that a GPU with more available VRAM may be necessary, or that the code being run should be modified to reduce the memory usage" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Here are the recommended solutions:

**For machine learning models running out of memory:**
- Try reducing the batch size 
- Ensure your data management is optimized [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

**Alternative GPU options:**
Looking at the current GPU availability, you might consider requesting a GPU with more VRAM. The available options include [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/):
- **A100**: 80GB or 40GB VRAM
- **A40**: 48GB VRAM  
- **L40S**: 48GB VRAM
- **RTX8000**: 48GB VRAM
- **V100**: 32GB or 16GB VRAM

Your current GPU appears to have ~12GB VRAM (likely a 2080Ti based on the 11.91 GiB capacity), so upgrading to any of the higher-capacity GPUs listed above should resolve the memory constraint.

**Monitoring GPU usage:**
You can monitor your GPU usage using the nvitop tool. To install it: `pip install nvitop`. Once installed, "it can be used either as a standalone process or within a python script for a more detailed analysis" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

You can also check current GPU availability using the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command to see which GPU types have idle resources available [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

### Thread: Issues figuring out how to acquire resources for test runs

**Thread Summary:**

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, I can help you understand why your jobs are pending and suggest some optimization strategies for your resource requests.

## Why Your Jobs Are Pending

The documentation explains that **large VRAM GPUs are often in high demand and jobs should be prepared to spend time in the queue** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). Your request for 500G of GPU memory is extremely large - looking at the available GPU resources, the largest single GPU has only 102GB VRAM (GH200) [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

## Recommendations to Reduce Queue Time

### 1. Use Available GPU Monitoring Tools
Use the helper scripts to check current GPU availability:
- **`unity-slurm-gpu-usage`** - shows which GPU types are currently available [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)
- **`unity-slurm-node-usage`** - shows idle resources per node [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)

### 2. Select the Right GPU Type
The documentation emphasizes: **"To reduce time a job is spent waiting in the queue, select the least powerful GPU that can run your code"** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). For your Llama3 70B model, consider:

- **GH200**: 102GB VRAM [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- **A100-SXM4-80GB**: 80GB VRAM [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

### 3. Use Multiple GPUs Strategically
If you need more than 102GB total, you'll need multiple GPUs. However, the documentation warns: **"Many codes only use a single GPU. Please avoid requesting multiple GPUs unless you are certain that your code can use them efficiently!"** [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

### 4. Consider Preempt Partitions for Testing
For your testing and troubleshooting workflow, consider using **gpu-preempt** partition for jobs under 2 hours. This can get you faster access, though jobs may be preempted [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

### 5. Use Constraints Effectively
Use constraint options to specify multiple acceptable GPU types:
```bash
#SBATCH --constraint=gh200|a100
```
This allows the scheduler more flexibility in resource allocation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

## Next Steps
I'd recommend sharing your batch script as you mentioned - this would help identify if there are specific optimizations possible in your resource requests. Also, run `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to see current availability of high-memory GPUs before submitting jobs.

- Average Tokens/Second: 473.48

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

To check if your disk quota is full, Unity provides several methods to monitor your quota usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

## Check Your Quota Usage

**Use the `df` command to check available space:**
```bash
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you the filesystem size, used space, available space, and usage percentage. For example:
```
Filesystem     Size  Used Avail Use% File
vast2:/home     50G   29G   22G  58%    ~
```

## Identify What's Using Your Space

**Use the `du` command to see which files are consuming space:**
```bash
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This will show you the disk usage of different directories, helping you identify where your space is being used [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

## Interactive Directory Explorer

**Use the `ncdu` command for an interactive interface:**
```bash
ncdu
```
This provides a visual, navigable interface showing which directories and files are taking up the most space. You can use arrow keys to navigate and press 'Q' to exit [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

If you find that your quota is exceeded, you'll need to free up space by moving files to directories with larger quotas (like `/work`), deleting unnecessary files, or compressing directories [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

#### Q2: Is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

To check your disk quota on Unity HPC, you can use several methods [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

**Check quota usage:**
Use the `df` (disk free) command to check available space:
```
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you the filesystem size, used space, available space, and usage percentage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

**Check which files are using space:**
Use the `du` (disk usage) command to see which files are taking up space:
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
[[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

**Interactive exploration:**
Use the `ncdu` (ncurses disk usage) command for an interactive interface to explore your directory tree [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

**To increase storage space on Unity:**

First, check if you can reduce storage use without expansion by following the storage management information [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

**Storage options available:**
- **Home directories:** 50 GB base quota [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- **Work directories:** 1TB free tier, can purchase additional 1TB increments on 6-month intervals up to 3 years [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- **Project directories:** 5TB free tier (varies by institution), can purchase additional 5TB increments on 1-year intervals up to 5 years [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- **Scratch space:** 50TB soft cap, no purchasing necessary [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

**To request additional storage:**
1. Determine the amount, duration, and type of storage needed using their flowchart [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
2. If purchasing is required, identify payment method and finance representative
3. Email hpc@umass.edu (must be done by PI or with PI consent) [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are the file transfer methods available for Unity and their characteristics for large files:

**For Large File Transfers:**

1. **Globus** - This is specifically mentioned as "useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/). Globus Connect allows transfers between Globus collections and is particularly useful when migrating between HPC clusters [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/).

2. **rsync** - This command is recommended "for recurring tasks and synchronizing files over a network" [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/) and comes with useful options like the `-tlp` flags that preserve timestamps, relative links, and permissions [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

**Other Available Methods:**

3. **scp** - Described as good "for quick work via the command line" and provides "a simple and straightforward copy" [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

4. **Unity OnDemand** - While noted as "the most intuitive interface," it specifically "can't transfer large files" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

5. **FileZilla** - Good for users familiar with the software who have SSH keys set up [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

**Important Note:** The context mentions that "uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow," but "UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve speeds" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

For large file transfers specifically, **Globus** appears to be the recommended solution based on the provided information.

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, the issue you're encountering is likely related to file path accessibility within the Apptainer container build environment. When building a container with a `.def` file, the build environment has a different file system context than your host system.

Here are a few approaches to resolve this issue based on the container building examples in the documentation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

**Option 1: Copy the file into the container during build**
In your `.def` file, use the `%files` section to copy your `Modular.R` file into the container before trying to execute it:

```
%files
    /path/to/Modular.R /opt/Modular.R

%post
    Rscript /opt/Modular.R
```

**Option 2: Include the R script content directly in %post**
Instead of referencing an external file, you could include the installation commands directly in the `%post` section of your `.def` file, similar to the example shown [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

```
%post
    # Install R packages directly
    Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak")'
    Rscript -e 'pak::pak(c("package1", "package2"))'
```

The context shows that R package installation should be done during the container build process in the `%post` section [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/), and the documentation specifically notes that you should not install packages in scripts run by slurm [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/).

If you need more specific guidance on your particular use case, I'd recommend reaching out to our help desk at hpc@umass.edu or visiting our community page at https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/.

- Total Cost: $0.020193
- Average Tokens/Second: 482.63

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, Unity provides high performance scratch space through a tool called **HPC Workspace**. Here's how you can check if you have scratch space and how to create it:

## To check if you already have scratch workspaces:

Use the `ws_list` command to view a list of your existing workspaces [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/):

```
username@login2:~$ ws_list -v
```

This will show you all your current workspaces with details like remaining time, creation date, and expiration date.

## To create new scratch space:

You don't need to "apply" for scratch space - you can create workspaces directly using the `ws_allocate` command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/):

```
username@login2:~$ ws_allocate simple 14
```

This creates a workspace named "simple" for 14 days. Key details:
- **Maximum duration**: 30 days per workspace [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- **Extensions available**: You can extend workspaces up to 5 times [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- **Soft cap**: 50TB for scratch space [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- **No purchasing necessary** for scratch space [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

The workspace will be created in `/scratch/workspace/username-workspacename` format.

You can also set up email reminders before expiration and create shared workspaces for collaboration with your PI group members [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, for uploading a really large .pkl file to Unity, **Globus is the best option**. 

The documentation states that "Globus is useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/). 

While other methods are available (Unity OnDemand, FileZilla, and command line tools), the context specifically notes that "Unity OnDemand is the most intuitive interface, but can't transfer large files" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/), making it unsuitable for your large .pkl file.

Additionally, the documentation mentions that "uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/), though UMass Amherst has optimized connectivity to improve speeds.

For your large .pkl file transfer, you would need to set up Globus Connect on your personal computer and use it to transfer to the Unity Globus endpoint.

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

However, I can provide some general guidance from the documentation that might help:

For reducing queue times, the documentation suggests:
- Select the least powerful GPU that can run your code [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Use the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command to see available GPU resources and tailor your job to use idle resources [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)

For requesting more time, you have different partition options:
- For jobs requiring less than 2 hours: use `gpu-preempt` partition [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- For jobs 2 days or less: use `gpu` partition [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- For jobs more than 2 days: specify `-q long` as well [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

The documentation also emphasizes requesting only the minimum necessary resources to avoid wasting compute power and ensure fair access for all users [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

#### Q2: Can I get the GUI to show up on the cluster?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, Unity OnDemand offers a superior alternative to X11 forwarding for running graphical applications on the cluster.

**Unity OnDemand's Batch Connect Feature:**
Unity OnDemand provides Batch Connect as a way to run graphical applications. Batch Connect starts your software as a batch job, then connects you to your software through a VNC server. Anything that you could have run with X11 forwarding can now be run much faster and more easily through Batch Connect [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/).

**Available GUI Applications:**
As of May 2025, Unity OnDemand provides VSCode, JupyterLab, Matlab, RStudio, Mathematica, and a Virtual Desktop environment, which is a general-purpose interactive desktop environment [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/).

**How to Access GUI Applications:**
1. Login to Unity OnDemand with your organization's identity provider [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/)
2. Click the "My Interactive Sessions" icon from the top menu [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/)
3. Select an Interactive App from the side menu [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/)
4. Fill in the resource requirements (CPU threads, time, GPUs) and click "Launch" [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/)
5. Once the job is running, click the connect button to access your GUI application [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/)

This approach eliminates the need to configure X11 forwarding and provides better performance for graphical applications on Unity.
