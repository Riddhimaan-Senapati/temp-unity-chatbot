#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here's how to load a CUDA module in a SLURM sbatch script for GPU computing:

1. In your batch script, you can load a CUDA module using the `module load` command. [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) provides an example of this in a sample batch script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu # GPU partition
#SBATCH -G 1 # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00 # Job time limit

module load cuda/11.8 # Load a specific CUDA version
nvcc --version # Verify CUDA installation
```

2. Important notes about CUDA:
- CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform
- It provides access to the NVIDIA compiler suite (nvcc, nvfortran)
- You can list available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

3. When using CUDA, be sure to check which version is compatible with your specific software [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

4. For GPU jobs, you'll typically want to specify GPU-related SLURM parameters like partition (`-p gpu` or `gpu-preempt`) and GPU allocation (`--gpus=1`) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are some best practices for SLURM sbatch scripts regarding environment variables and module loading:

1. Batch Script Structure:
- Always start with the interpreter declaration: `#!/bin/bash` [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/)
- Use `#SBATCH` directives to specify job parameters like cores, memory, time, and partition [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/)

2. Environment Variables:
- You can leverage environment variables like `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` for:
  - Selecting specific datasets
  - Setting random number generator seeds
  - Parameterizing job array tasks [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/arrays/)

Example of using `SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`:
```bash
DATA_SET=$(sed -n "${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}p" input.txt)
```

3. Module Loading:
- Use `module load` to load required software before running your main script [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/)
- Place module loading commands after `#SBATCH` directives

4. Job Resource Specifications:
Key parameters to consider:
- `--time`: Job runtime limit [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/)
- `--cpus-per-task`: Number of cores per task [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/)
- `--mem`: Memory allocation per node [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/)

5. Output and Error Handling:
- Use `#SBATCH --output` to specify output log file [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/venv/)
- Consider using `#SBATCH --mail-type` for job status notifications [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/)

Example Comprehensive Batch Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4           # Cores per task
#SBATCH --mem=8G       # Memory per node
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00 # Time limit
#SBATCH --output=job_%j.log  # Output log

# Load required modules
module load python/3.8
module load cuda/11.8

# Activate virtual environment if needed
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate

# Run your script
python your_script.py
```

These practices will help you create efficient and well-structured SLURM batch scripts on the Unity HPC cluster.

1. Reduce Batch Size: For machine learning models running out of memory, a primary recommendation is to reduce the batch size [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). This will decrease the memory requirements of your job.

2. Memory Management Suggestions:
   - Try setting the environment variable `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` as suggested in your error message
   - Optimize your data management to reduce memory usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

3. GPU Selection: Check the available GPU types using the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command to find GPUs with more available VRAM [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/). From the GPU usage data, you might consider:
   - A100 GPUs with 80 GB VRAM
   - L40S GPUs with 48 GB VRAM
   - GH200 with 80 GB VRAM

4. Monitoring Tools: To better understand your GPU usage, you can use:
   - `nvidia-smi pmon` to view ongoing GPU processes [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
   - `nvitop` for an interactive view of NVIDIA GPU processes [[1][2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

Would you like help implementing any of these strategies?

#### Q1: I was running an interactive job with srun and suddenly got these errors:
slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get usage(15): GPU is lost
slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get Compute running process count(15): GPU is lost
Not sure what that means, and I'm unable to cancel the job 30185792

**Response:**

This error message suggests a serious GPU-related issue. Based on the provided context, here are some insights and recommendations:

1. "GPU is lost" typically indicates a critical hardware or driver problem with the GPU [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). This could mean:
   - The GPU has encountered a critical error
   - There might be a hardware failure
   - A driver or system issue has occurred

2. Troubleshooting steps:
   - Since you're unable to cancel the job normally, you may need to use `scancel` with the job ID: `scancel 30185792`
   - If `scancel` doesn't work, you might need to contact Unity HPC support at hpc@umass.edu for further assistance

3. Additional Monitoring:
   - You can use the `nvitop` tool [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) to monitor GPU usage and potentially diagnose issues
   - Install nvitop with: `pip install nvitop`

4. Recommendations:
   - Check your GPU-intensive code for potential memory issues
   - Verify that your software is compatible with the GPU you're using
   - Consider using a different GPU or node for your job

For the most accurate diagnosis and resolution, I recommend reaching out to the Unity HPC help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visiting their community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are some recommendations for improving your job scheduling and resource acquisition:

1. GPU Resource Selection:
For a large model like Llama3 70b requiring 500GB of GPU memory, you'll want to carefully select your GPU resources. [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) From the available GPU resources, the closest match would likely be the GH200 with 102GB VRAM or the A100-SXM4-80GB with 80GB VRAM.

2. Resource Request Optimization:
[[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) Here are some strategies to potentially improve your job scheduling:
- Request the minimum necessary resources to ensure fair access
- Consider using priority partitions like `--partition=gpu,superpod-a100`
- For shorter jobs (under 2 hours), use the `gpu-preempt` partition
- For jobs under 4 hours, you can boost priority with `--qos=short`

3. Resource Checking:
I recommend using these helper scripts to understand current GPU availability:
- `unity-slurm-gpu-usage`: Check GPU allocation status
- `unity-slurm-node-usage`: See idle resources across nodes

4. Practical Advice:
[[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) Some additional guidance:
- Conduct a scaling analysis to determine optimal GPU usage
- Ensure your code is explicitly written to utilize GPUs efficiently
- Avoid requesting multiple GPUs unless you're certain your code can use them

5. Monitoring:
[[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) To understand job performance:
- Use `seff <job_id>` to get efficiency statistics
- Monitor resources using `nvidia-smi` or `nvitop`

Recommendation: If you'd like more specific guidance, I'd be happy to review your batch script to help optimize your resource requests. The more details you can provide about your specific job requirements, the better advice I can offer.

Would you like to share your current batch script for a more targeted review?

### Thread: Disk usage

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 4
- Total Response Time: 39.380 seconds
- Average Response Time: 9.845 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.021679
- Average Tokens/Second: 496.06

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

I can help you check your disk usage quota on Unity. Here are three methods you can use to check your disk space:

1. **df Command (Disk Free):**
Use the `df` command to check available space in your home directory:
```
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you the total size, used space, available space, and usage percentage for your home directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

2. **du Command (Disk Usage):**
Use the `du` command to see which files are consuming space:
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This will recursively list space usage for files and subdirectories in your .cache folder [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

3. **ncdu Interactive Tool:**
For an interactive way to explore your directory tree and disk usage, use:
```
$ ncdu
```
This tool provides a navigable interface where you can see disk usage by directory and file [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

**Additional Context:**
- Home directories on Unity have a default quota of 50 GB [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- If you exceed your quota, software may produce strange error messages
- If your home directory is full, you'll need to create space before software can work properly

**If you need more space:**
- Consider moving files to `/work` or `/project` directories
- Delete unnecessary files (especially in `~/.cache`)
- Compress directories
- Request storage expansion by emailing hpc@umass.edu

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods or provide more detailed guidance on managing your disk quota?

     * Can be purchased for up to 5 years [[Source 5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

Alternative Space Management Strategies:
1. Move files to different directories:
   - Use /work (larger quotas) instead of /home
   - Consider /project for long-term storage [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

2. Delete unnecessary files:
   - Clear cache directories (e.g., `rm -rf ~/.cache/pip`)
   - Be cautious and verify before deletion [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

3. Compress directories:
   - Use `zip` to compress directories
   - Consider temporary scratch space for extraction [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are the details about file transfer methods for the Unity HPC cluster:

File Transfer Methods:
Unity offers several methods to transfer files [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/):
1. Unity OnDemand (most intuitive, but limited for large files)
2. FileZilla 
3. Globus (best for large file transfers between Globus endpoints)
4. Command-line tools (scp and rsync)

Command-Line Transfer Options:

1. SCP (Secure Copy):
- Simple and straightforward method [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)
- Comes with OpenSSH
- Transfer examples:
  ```
  # Single file
  scp FILE_NAME unity:~
  
  # Entire directory
  scp -r DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
  ```

2. RSYNC:
- Recommended for recurring tasks and network file synchronization [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)
- Requires installation on Linux/Mac
- Preserves timestamps, links, and permissions
- Transfer examples:
  ```
  # Single file
  rsync -tlp FILE_NAME unity:~
  
  # Entire directory
  rsync -rtlp DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
  ```

Important Notes:
- All file transfers must use an SSL encrypted connection [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- Uploading files via residential internet is typically very slow
- UMass Amherst has a fiber line to MGHPCC to improve transfer speeds
- SSH keys are required for FileZilla and console methods

Recommendation for Large Files:
For large file transfers, Globus is the most recommended method [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the context provided, here are some insights and suggestions for your R package installation in an Apptainer container:

1. Container Build Process:
When building an Apptainer container, you'll want to ensure that the Modular.R script is properly included in the container definition file. [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:4.4.0
%files
    /path/to/Modular.R /Modular.R
%post
    Rscript /Modular.R
```

2. Installation Considerations:
A few important points to keep in mind:
- Do not use `install.packages()` directly in SLURM jobs [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)
- Consider alternative package management tools like Pak, which can help with dependency resolution [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/renv/)

3. Potential Package Installation Solutions:
If Modular.R is having trouble writing to system directories, you might want to:
- Specify a writable library path
- Use `BiocManager::install()` with a custom library location [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)

Recommendation: I suggest creating a specific writable directory in the container for package installations and modifying Modular.R to use that directory.

For further specific troubleshooting, you may want to reach out to the help desk at hpc@umass.edu for more detailed assistance with your specific Modular.R script.

- Average Tokens/Second: 457.85

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here's how you can create and manage scratch space on Unity using the HPC Workspace tool:

1. Creating a Scratch Space:
You can create a workspace using the `ws_allocate` command. For example:
```
username@login2:~$ ws_allocate simple 14
```
This creates a workspace for 14 days, with a maximum duration of 30 days [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

2. Scratch Space Details:
- Unity provides 50T of scratch space with a soft cap [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- You can create workspaces using different options:
  - For a single user
  - With email reminders
  - Shared workspaces for group collaboration

3. Useful Commands:
- To list your workspaces: `ws_list`
- To extend a workspace: `ws_extend`
- To release a workspace when done: `ws_release`

4. Additional Notes:
- The number of extensions for scratch spaces has been increased from 3 to 5
- It's recommended to release workspaces when they're no longer needed to optimize scratch space for all users [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)

If you need help determining if scratch space is right for your needs, Unity provides a storage flowchart to guide you [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). For specific questions or additional assistance, you can email hpc@umass.edu.

### Thread: Upload large pkl files

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, for uploading a large .pkl file, I recommend using Globus. 

[[Source 1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/) specifically notes that while Unity OnDemand is the most intuitive interface, it "can't transfer large files". The context explicitly states that "Globus is useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect."

The alternative large file transfer methods mentioned include:
1. Command-line tools like scp and rsync (good for quick work)
2. FileZilla (good if you have SSH keys set up)

However, for a really large .pkl file, Globus is recommended as the most efficient method. A helpful tip from the context is that "Uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow", but UMass Amherst has a fiber line directly to MGHPCC to help improve transfer speeds.

If you need specific guidance on using Globus, I recommend visiting the Unity documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and using Globus for file transfers.
