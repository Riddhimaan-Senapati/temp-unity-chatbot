- You can optionally specify specific GPU types using `#SBATCH --constraint=2080ti` [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

3. Submit the job using the `sbatch` command:
```bash
sbatch your_cuda_script.sh
```

This approach will help you set up a CUDA module environment in a SLURM sbatch script on the Unity HPC cluster.

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are some recommended initial commands and practices for a SLURM sbatch script:

1. Interpreter and Basic Structure:
Start your script with the bash interpreter and include necessary SLURM directives [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4           # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192     # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu         # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1           # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00    # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out # Output file with job ID
```

2. Module Loading:
After SLURM directives, load any required modules. For example, for a CUDA-related job:
```bash
module load cuda/11.8
```

3. Recommended Practices:
- Specify the number of cores, memory, and time limit appropriate to your job
- Use the `-o` option to specify an output file that includes the job ID
- Load any necessary modules before running your main commands

4. Additional Optional Configurations:
- Email notifications: `#SBATCH --mail-type=BEGIN,END,FAIL`
- Specify email: `#SBATCH --mail-user=your_email@example.com`

The exact configuration will depend on your specific job requirements [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

To submit the job, use the `sbatch` command:
```bash
sbatch your_script.sh
```

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

Based on the context provided, here are some recommendations for addressing the Out of Memory error:

For machine learning models running out of memory, you can try the following strategies [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

1. Reduce Batch Size: This is often the most straightforward way to decrease memory usage. Modify your code to use a smaller batch size.

2. Optimize Data Management: Ensure that your data handling is as efficient as possible.

3. Consider Memory Allocation: The error suggests trying the environment variable `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to potentially avoid memory fragmentation.

Additionally, you might want to:
- Check if you need a GPU with more available VRAM [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Use the `nvidia-smi` or `nvitop` tools to monitor your GPU memory usage [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

When selecting a GPU, consider [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
- Choose the minimum amount of VRAM that can fit your needs
- Be prepared for potential queue times for large VRAM GPUs
- Use constraints to specify necessary GPU requirements

For a comprehensive view of available GPUs on Unity, you can use the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command to see current GPU allocations and idle resources [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I'll offer some guidance on improving your GPU resource allocation for running large models like Llama3 70b:

1. GPU Resource Selection:
For extremely large models requiring significant GPU memory, you'll want to carefully select your GPU. [[Source 5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) shows that the largest GPU currently available on Unity is:
- NVIDIA GH200 with 102GB VRAM (constraint: gh200)
- NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with 80GB VRAM (constraint: a100, a100-80g)

2. Partition and Job Selection:
[[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) recommends:
- For jobs requiring extensive resources, consider specifying multiple priority partitions
- Example: `--partition=gpu,superpod-a100` or `--partition=gpu,gpu-preempt,uri-gpu`

3. Resource Allocation Tips:
[[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) suggests:
- Request the minimum necessary resources to ensure fair access
- Use `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to check current GPU availability and pending jobs

4. Handling Long Wait Times:
[[Source 6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/troubleshooting/) offers strategies:
- For urgent jobs, you can de-prioritize other queued jobs using `scontrol update jobid=... nice=100`
- Consider using Quality of Service (QOS) for shorter wait times

Recommendation:
1. Modify your batch script to request the GH200 or A100-80GB GPU
2. Use multiple priority partitions
3. Consider breaking your work into smaller, more manageable job arrays if possible

Would you be willing to share your current batch script? That would help me provide more specific guidance on optimizing your resource request.

#### Q2: What difference is it to use a model that exists locally rather than use one that's online? It must be quicker to run, correct?

**Response:**

I apologize, but I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question based solely on the provided context. The documents are specifically about the Unity HPC cluster's hardware specifications, GPU resources, and job scheduling, but do not discuss AI model deployment strategies, local vs. cloud inference performance, or comparative memory usage analysis.

If you're interested in understanding the GPU capabilities of the Unity cluster that might be relevant to AI workloads, I can share some details:

GPU Resources on Unity:
1. The cluster offers multiple GPU types with varying specifications [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/nodes/):
- NVIDIA Tesla V100 (16-32 GB VRAM)
- NVIDIA Tesla A100 (40-80 GB VRAM)
- NVIDIA Ada Lovelace L40S (48 GB VRAM)
- NVIDIA H100 (80 GB HBM3 VRAM)

2. For GPU-based workloads, Unity recommends [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/):
- Only use GPUs for codes explicitly written to run on GPUs
- Conduct scaling analysis to determine optimal GPU resources
- Select appropriate GPU type based on compute capability and memory requirements

For a detailed comparison of local AI model deployment vs. cloud inference, I recommend consulting specialized AI infrastructure documentation or research papers, as this specific context does not address that topic.

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

I can help you check your disk usage quota on Unity. Here are a few methods you can use:

1. Check Quota Usage with df Command:
Use the `df` command to check the free space in your home directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
```
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you:
- Total size of the filesystem
- Used space
- Available space
- Percentage of space used

2. Detailed File Usage with du Command:
To see which files are using up your space, use the `du` command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This will recursively show disk usage for files and directories in your .cache folder.

3. Interactive Directory Tree Exploration:
For an interactive view of disk usage, use the `ncdu` command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
```
$ ncdu
```
Use arrow keys to navigate, and press '?' for help. This tool lets you explore which directories and files are taking up the most space.

💡 Pro Tip: If you're approaching or have exceeded your home directory's 50GB quota [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/), consider:
- Moving files to `/work` or `/project` directories
- Deleting unnecessary cached files
- Compressing large directories
- Requesting additional storage from your PI

#### Q2: Is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

I'll help you with disk quota check commands and storage allocation options on Unity HPC.

Disk Quota Check Commands:
1. Check Quota Usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
   - Use the `df` (disk free) command to check free space:
     ```
     $ df -h ~
     ```
   - This will show you the filesystem size, used space, available space, and usage percentage.

2. Check File Space Usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
   - Use the `du` (disk usage) command to see space usage by files/directories:
     ```
     $ du -sh ~/.cache/*
     ```

3. Interactive Directory Exploration [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):
   - Use `ncdu` for an interactive directory tree exploration:
     ```
     $ ncdu ~
     ```

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are the best practices for transferring large files on the Unity HPC cluster:

1. File Transfer Methods:
Unity provides several methods for file transfer [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/):
- Unity OnDemand (intuitive but limited for large files)
- FileZilla
- Globus (recommended for large file transfers)
- Command-line tools (scp and rsync)

2. Command-Line Transfer Recommendations:
For command-line transfers, you have two primary options:

a) SCP (Simple Copy):
- Good for straightforward, simple file transfers
- Comes with OpenSSH by default
- Example commands:
  ```
  # Single file
  scp FILE_NAME unity:~
  # Entire directory
  scp -r DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
  ```
[[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)

b) RSYNC (Recommended for Large/Recurring Transfers):
- Better for large files and network synchronization
- Preserves file attributes with flags
- Example commands:
  ```
  # Single file
  rsync -tlp FILE_NAME unity:~
  # Entire directory
  rsync -rtlp DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
  ```
[[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)

3. Important Considerations:
- Use SSL encrypted connections for file transfers
- Set up SSH keys for FileZilla and console methods
- Note that residential internet is typically slow
- UMass Amherst has a fiber line to MGHPCC for improved transfer speeds [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

4. Large File Transfer Recommendation:
For truly large file transfers, Globus is the most recommended method. It specializes in transferring large datasets between different endpoints [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/).

5. Windows Users Warning:
If using PowerShell SSH, you must add specific MAC configurations to avoid connection issues [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

Recommendation: For large files, use Globus or rsync with appropriate flags (-tlp) to ensure complete and accurate file transfers.

### Thread: R env

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I can offer some guidance about running R scripts in Apptainer containers:

1. File Path in Container Build:
When building an Apptainer container, you'll need to copy the Modular.R script into the container during the build process. In your definition file, you should use the %files section to copy the script [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

```
%files
/path/to/Modular.R /path/in/container/Modular.R
```

2. Package Installation Considerations:
When installing packages in an HPC environment like Unity, be aware of a few key points:
- Do not use install.packages() directly in scripts run by Slurm [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)
- Consider using alternative package management tools like:
  - pak: Warns about system dependencies
  - BiocManager::install() for Bioconductor packages [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)

3. Virtual Environment Option:
If package management is complex, you might want to consider using renv for managing R package dependencies [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/renv/).

For your specific path issue, ensure:
- The script is correctly copied into the container
- You're using the full, absolute path when running Rscript
- The container build process includes the necessary file copy step

Would you like me to help you draft a complete Apptainer definition file that includes copying and running your Modular.R script?

- Total Cost: $0.007737
- Average Tokens/Second: 733.01

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

Great question! Unity provides a tool called HPC Workspace to help you create and manage high-performance scratch space. Here's how you can create a workspace:

1. Creating a Workspace:
You can use the `ws_allocate` command to create a scratch workspace. For example:
```
username@login2:~$ ws_allocate workspacename 14
```
This creates a workspace named "workspacename" that will last for 14 days [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

2. Workspace Details:
- The maximum duration for a workspace is 30 days
- You have 5 possible extensions available

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

Based on the context provided, for uploading a large .pkl file, I recommend using Globus or the command line tools scp and rsync [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

Specifically:
- Unity OnDemand is **not recommended for large files** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- FileZilla can be used if you have SSH keys set up [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- Globus is particularly useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- Command-line tools like scp and rsync are good for quick work and can handle large files [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

A few additional tips:
- Uploading files using residential internet is typically very slow [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- UMass Amherst has a fiber line directly to MGHPCC to improve transfer speeds [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

I would recommend Globus or rsync as the most efficient methods for large file transfers to Unity.

- Average Tokens/Second: 1171.72

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

I apologize, but the provided context does not contain specific information about average wait times for jobs with 500GB RAM and 4 GPU cores. 

However, I can provide some relevant guidance about job scheduling and requesting resources on Unity:

1. Partition Selection:
For short jobs (less than 2 hours), you should use the gpu-preempt partition [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). An example submission might look like:
```bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=4
#SBATCH --mem=500G
```

2. For Longer Jobs:
- Jobs longer than 2 hours in the preempt partition may be terminated to make way for higher-priority jobs [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).
- For jobs over 2 days, you can specify the long queue and add the `-q long` parameter.

3. Reducing Wait Time Strategies:
- Select less powerful GPUs if possible [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- Use `unity-slurm-partition-usage` to check current partition loads
- Consider using tools like `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to find idle resources [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)

For specific wait time details or complex resource requests, I recommend contacting the Unity help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visiting their community page.

### Thread: Install program to directory

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 2

- Total Cost: $0.013574
- Average Tokens/Second: 763.79

#### Q1: Hi, would it be possible for me to install this program on my work directory and any advice on how to go about it?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I can offer some advice about using the work directory:

[[Source 5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/) indicates that the /work directory is:
- An SSD-based storage location
- Has a base quota of 1 TB
- Is the primary location for running cluster jobs
- A shared folder for all users in the PI group

When installing a program in the work directory, you should:
1. Ensure you have space available in your PI group's work directory
2. Confirm you have the necessary permissions
3. Consider using a subdirectory specific to your project

A few additional recommendations:
- If you need more space, you can [[Source 5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/) request additional storage by emailing hpc@umass.edu
- Be mindful of storage usage, as the work directory is meant for active job-related files

For specific installation steps or detailed guidance about your particular program, I recommend reaching out to the help desk at hpc@umass.edu or consulting your PI group for more specific advice about your installation.
