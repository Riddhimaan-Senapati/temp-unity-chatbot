#### Q1: What is the Unity HPC?

**Response:**

Unity is a collaborative, multi-institutional high-performance computing platform located at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/). Unity is under active development and supports primarily research activities [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/).

Partnering institutions currently include UMass Amherst, University of Rhode Island, UMass Dartmouth, UMass Lowell, UMass Boston, and Mount Holyoke College [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/).

As of late 2024, Unity is an over 25,000 core cluster based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Slurm with a heterogeneous network containing ethernet and IB linked compute nodes [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/). Unity hosts a variety of compute node architectures, with the majority being Intel or AMD x86-64 nodes, plus a small number of ARM and Power9 nodes to supplement [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/). Additionally, Unity contains ~1300 Nvidia GPUs, including over 100 A100, L40S, and V100 GPUs [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/).

For storage, Unity contains 1.5 PB high performance VAST for home, work, and scratch directories, and 2 PB storage from the New England Storage Exchange (NESE), a regionally managed Ceph cluster located at the same data center as Unity [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/).

#### Q1: How do I access Unity?

**Response:**

There are several ways to access Unity:

## Unity OnDemand (Recommended)
Unity OnDemand is the simplest and most convenient method because it allows you to login through your browser [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/). You can sign in using your organization's identity provider without needing to install SSH, configure SSH, or set up any public and private keys [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/).

To access Unity OnDemand:
1. Login to Unity OnDemand with your organization's identity provider
2. From the top menu, click "Shell"
3. In the dropdown menu, click "Unity Shell Access" [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/)

## SSH Connection

#### Q3: Okay, thanks for the info. I got this other error on an A100 node (gpu023) from job 34002652. The script ran fine when I added --exclude gpu023.
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52: UserWarning: CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount(). Did you run some cuda functions before calling NumCudaDevices() that might have already set an error? Error 802: system not yet initialized (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:109.)
  return torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0
...
    assert torch.cuda.is_available()
AssertionError:

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I can help you troubleshoot CUDA initialization errors with A100 GPUs and `torch.cuda.is_available()` issues. Here are the key points to address:

## Common CUDA/GPU Setup Issues

**For TensorFlow/PyTorch GPU Environment Setup:**
When setting up a GPU environment, you need to load the proper CUDA and cuDNN modules. For TensorFlow, the recommended setup is [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

```bash
module load conda/latest
module load cuda/12.6
module load cudnn/8.9.7.29-12-cuda12.6
```

**CUDA Compatibility:**
Be sure to check which version(s) of CUDA are compatible with the software that is being used [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). You can list available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

## A100 GPU Specifications and Access

**Available A100 Resources:**
Unity has multiple types of A100 GPUs available [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/gpu_summary/):
- NVIDIA Tesla A100 with 40GB VRAM (8 GPUs total)
- NVIDIA Tesla A100 with 80GB VRAM (177 GPUs total across different partitions)

**Job Exclusivity for A100 Nodes:**
For A100 nodes with NVSwitch connectivity, you may need to use `--exclusive` to get an entire node [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/). The A100 nodes have NVSwitch, so all GPUs are linked to each other, and nodes gpu[013-024] are connected with Infiniband for low-latency networking [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

## Troubleshooting Steps

**Check GPU Allocation:**
When using multiple GPUs on a node, be sure to use the Slurm variable `SLURM_GPUS_ON_NODE` to ensure that ALL allocated GPUs on a node can be accessed by your software [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

**Debugging GPU Issues:**
To troubleshoot GPU problems, you can [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
1. Use `nvidia-smi -L` to find out which GPU is being used
2. Use `nvidia-smi pmon` to view ongoing GPU processes
3. Use `nvitop` for an interactive view of GPU processes

**Check Job Resources:**
You can check your job's GPU allocation using [[17]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/monitoring/):
```bash
scontrol -d show job <jobid>
```
This will show the `JOB_GRES=gpu:a100:4` and `GRES=gpu:a100:4(IDX:0-3)` information.

If you're still experiencing issues after checking these points, I recommend reaching out to the help desk at hpc@umass.edu for further assistance with your specific CUDA initialization error.

#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, when you encounter a "CUDA_HOME not existing" error while using GPUs in sbatch jobs, this typically means that the CUDA environment isn't properly set up. Here's how to resolve this issue:

## Load the Required CUDA Module

You need to load the CUDA module in your batch script before running your GPU-enabled code. The documentation shows that CUDA modules are available and should be loaded for most GPU jobs [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Add these lines to your batch script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1
#SBATCH --mem=8G

# Load CUDA module
module load cuda/12.6  # or another available version
```

## Check Available CUDA Versions

To see which CUDA versions are available on Unity, use:
```bash
module spider cuda
```

The documentation emphasizes that you should "be sure to check which version(s) of cuda are compatible with the software that is being used" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

## For TensorFlow GPU Environment

If you're working with TensorFlow specifically, the documentation provides a complete setup example that includes loading CUDA modules [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

```bash
module load conda/latest
module load cuda/12.6
module load cudnn/8.9.7.29-12-cuda12.6
```

## Additional Considerations

- CUDA provides "access to the NVIDIA compiler suite (nvcc, nvfortran) and the NVIDIA GPU profiling tool (nsys)" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Make sure you're using a GPU-enabled partition (like `gpu-preempt` or `gpu`) in your batch script
- The documentation recommends always using "the latest CUDA version" when possible [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

By properly loading the CUDA module in your batch script, the CUDA_HOME environment variable should be set automatically, resolving your error.

#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here's how to load a CUDA module in an sbatch script and work with CUDA environment variables:

## Loading CUDA Module in sbatch Script

To load a CUDA module in your sbatch script, include the `module load` command in your script [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4                # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192          # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu              # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1                # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00         # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out     # %j = job ID

module load cuda/11.8
nvcc --version
```

## Available CUDA Versions

You can check which CUDA versions are available using [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
```bash
module spider cuda
```

## CUDA Module Purpose

CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform, and loading a CUDA module is typically required for most GPU jobs because it provides access to [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
- NVIDIA compiler suite (nvcc, nvfortran)
- NVIDIA GPU profiling tool (nsys)

## Setting Up TensorFlow GPU Environment Example

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here's how to properly structure your batch script to load CUDA and submit jobs:

## Basic Batch Script Structure with CUDA

Every batch script should begin with the shebang line and SBATCH parameters, followed by module loading commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4                # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192          # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu              # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1                # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00         # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out     # %j = job ID

module load cuda/11.8
nvcc --version
```

## Key Points:

1. **Script Structure**: Start with `#!/bin/bash`, then add your `#SBATCH` parameters, followed by `module load` commands [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

2. **CUDA Module Loading**: Load the appropriate CUDA version with `module load cuda/11.8` (or your required version) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

3. **GPU Jobs**: When using CUDA, you'll typically need GPU resources, so include parameters like `#SBATCH -p gpu` for the GPU partition and `#SBATCH -G 1` for GPU allocation [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

4. **Available CUDA Versions**: You can check available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

5. **Job Submission**: Submit your batch script using `sbatch BATCH_SCRIPT` where BATCH_SCRIPT is your script filename [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

The module loading should occur within your batch script after the SBATCH parameters but before any commands that require CUDA functionality [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

Based on the error you're encountering, this is a GPU "Out of Memory" error. According to the documentation, `torch.cuda.OutOfMemory` means that a GPU with more available VRAM may be necessary, or that the code being run should be modified to reduce the memory usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Here are several approaches to resolve this issue:

## Option 1: Request a GPU with More VRAM
Your current GPU has ~12 GB of VRAM. You could request a GPU with more memory:
- **L40S**: 48 GB VRAM (available in gpu-preempt partition) [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- **A40**: 48 GB VRAM [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- **A100**: 40 GB or 80 GB VRAM [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

To request a specific GPU type, use constraints in your job script:
```bash
#SBATCH --constraint=l40s
# or
#SBATCH --gpus=l40s:1
```

## Option 2: Optimize Your Code
For machine learning models running out of memory, try:
- **Reducing the batch size** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- **Ensuring your data management is optimized** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Following PyTorch's suggestion to set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to avoid fragmentation

## Option 3: Monitor GPU Usage
To better understand your GPU memory usage patterns, you can use monitoring tools:
- **nvidia-smi**: Use `nvidia-smi pmon` to view ongoing GPU processes [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- **nvitop**: Offers an interactive view of ongoing processes for NVIDIA GPUs. Install with `pip install nvitop` [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

To choose the most appropriate GPU, you should **select the least powerful GPU that can run your code** to reduce queue times, as the large VRAM GPUs are often in high demand [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

### Thread: Issues figuring out how to acquire resources for test runs

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I can help you understand why your job is pending and suggest some strategies to get quicker results.

## Why Your Job is Pending

The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the very high GPU memory requirement (500GB). Looking at the available GPU resources on Unity [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/), the highest VRAM available is:
- NVIDIA GH200: 102GB VRAM
- NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB: 80GB VRAM  
- NVIDIA L40S and A40: 48GB VRAM each

Since no single GPU on Unity has 500GB of VRAM, you would need multiple high-end GPUs, which significantly increases queue time as noted in the documentation: "The large vram GPUs are often in high demand. Be prepared for your jobs to spend some time in the queue before being able to launch" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

## Strategies to Get Faster Results

### 1. Use GPU Monitoring Tools
Check current GPU availability using the helper script:
```bash
unity-slurm-gpu-usage
```
This shows you which GPUs are currently idle and might help you time your submissions better [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

### 2. Consider Alternative Partitions
For jobs requiring less than 2 hours, use the preempt partition which has higher priority:
```bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
```
However, note that jobs longer than 2 hours may be preempted [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

### 3. Optimize Your Resource Request
The documentation emphasizes: "To reduce time a job is spent waiting in the queue, select the least powerful GPU that can run your code" and "Request the minimum necessary resources to avoid wasting compute power" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

### 4. Use Interactive Jobs for Development
For troubleshooting and making changes in one session, consider using `salloc` for interactive jobs:
```bash
salloc -p gpu-preempt -t 02:00:00 --gpus=4 --mem=400G
```
This allows you to work interactively while maintaining your allocated resources [[20]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/salloc/).

## Recommendation

Given that you need 500GB of GPU memory, you'll likely need multiple high-end GPUs (possibly 5-7 A100-80GB or similar). The queue time for such large resource requests is unfortunately expected to be long due to high demand for these resources.

Would you be able to share your batch script? This would help identify if there are any optimizations possible in your resource allocation strategy.

#### Q2: What difference is it to use a model that exists locally rather than use one that's online? It must be quicker to run, correct?

**Response:**

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

However, I can share some general information about GPU memory considerations on Unity that might be helpful:

Unity has GPUs with various amounts of VRAM available, ranging from 8GB to 102GB [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). When choosing a GPU, it's recommended to "select the minimum amount of vram that can fit your needs" since "large vram GPUs are often in high demand" [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

If you encounter "Out of Memory" errors (such as CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY or torch.cuda.OutOfMemory), this means "a GPU with more available VRAM may be necessary, or that the code being run should be modified to reduce the memory usage. For machine learning models running out of memory, try reducing the batch size or ensuring your data management is optimized" [[13]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

### Thread: Disk usage

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 4
- Total Response Time: 55.360 seconds
- Average Response Time: 13.840 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.205407
- Average Tokens/Second: 1076.39

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

To check your disk quota usage on Unity, you can use the `df` (disk free) command. Here's how to check if your directories are full:

## Check your quota usage

Use the `df -h` command to check the amount of free space under the quota for a given directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

```bash
$ df -h ~
```

This will show you something like:
```
Filesystem     Size  Used Avail Use% File
vast2:/home     50G   29G   22G  58%    ~
```

The output shows:
- **Size**: Total quota allocation (50GB for home directories)
- **Used**: How much space you're currently using  
- **Avail**: How much space is still available
- **Use%**: Percentage of quota used

## Check which files are using space

If you need to see which files are taking up the most space, use the `du` (disk usage) command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

```bash
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```

## Interactive directory exploration

For a more interactive way to explore your directory usage, you can use the `ncdu` command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

```bash
$ ncdu ~
```

This provides a navigable interface showing which directories and files are using the most space. Press `Q` to exit.

## Storage quotas on Unity

For reference, here are the default quotas [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/):
- `/home` directories: 50GB quota
- `/work` directories: 1TB quota  
- `/project` directories: varies by request

If you find that your quota is exceeded, you'll need to either delete files, move them to a different directory with more space (like `/work`), or compress them to reduce usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

## How to Request Additional Storage

To request additional storage on Unity [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/):

1. **Check storage management information** to determine if you can reduce storage use without expansion
2. **Determine the amount, duration, and type of storage needed** using the provided flowchart and storage descriptions
3. **For paid expansions:** Identify the appropriate payment method (speedtype, Chartfield string, etc.) and finance representative contact information
4. **Email hpc@umass.edu** with your request
5. **Note:** If you're not the PI, this must be done by your PI or with your PI's consent

## Before Requesting More Storage

Consider these storage management strategies first [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/) [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/):

- **Move files** from your home directory to /work (larger quotas) or /project directories
- **Delete unnecessary files** (like cache files in ~/.cache)
- **Compress directories** to reduce space usage
- **Use scratch space** for temporary files during jobs

The documentation includes a helpful flowchart to determine the most appropriate storage solution for your specific needs [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, here are the key details about file transfer commands and performance on Unity HPC:

## Available File Transfer Commands

**rsync**: Linux and Mac users can use rsync for file transfers. The rsync command references the OpenSSH config file and comes with useful options like `-tlp` flags that preserve timestamps, relative links, and permissions respectively [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

**scp**: Available with OpenSSH, the scp command is similar to cp (copy) but can reference the OpenSSH config file. It's recommended for simple and straightforward copying without requiring additional installation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

**cp and mv**: The documentation mentions that cp is a local copy command, and notes that VAST storage can be slow when handling large numbers of small files, recommending the use of tmux or batch jobs for large I/O operations [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

## Performance Considerations for Large File Transfers

**Storage Performance**: Unity uses high-performance VAST DataStore for `/home`, `/work`, and `/scratch` directories, which is suitable for Job I/O and provides fast, parallel filesystem performance [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

**Network Considerations**: The documentation notes that "uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow. UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve speeds" [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

**Large File Transfer Recommendations**: For large file transfers, the documentation specifically mentions Globus as being "useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect" [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

## Usage Examples

For rsync:
```bash
# single file
rsync -tlp FILE_NAME unity:~
# entire directory  
rsync -rtlp DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
```

For scp:
```bash
# single file
scp FILE_NAME unity:~
# entire directory
scp -r DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
```

Both commands require proper OpenSSH configuration to use "unity" as the hostname [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the context provided, the issue you're encountering is likely related to how file paths work within Apptainer containers during the build process. When you're building a container with a `.def` file, the build environment is isolated and may not have access to files on your host system in the same way.

Here are a few approaches to resolve this issue:

1. **Copy the file into the container during build**: In your `.def` file, you can copy the `Modular.R` file into the container during the build process using the `%files` section:

```
%files
    /path/to/Modular.R /opt/Modular.R

%post
    # Your other installation commands
    Rscript /opt/Modular.R
```

2. **Use absolute paths that exist within the container**: Make sure the path you're referencing in the `%post` section actually exists within the container's filesystem during build time.

3. **Install packages in a writable location**: Since you mentioned that `/usr/...` isn't writable, you might want to modify your installation approach. According to the documentation, when installing R packages, they should be installed to your user library [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/). You could also consider using the `lib` parameter in your R installation commands to specify a writable location within the container.

For building custom R containers, the documentation shows this pattern [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:{{ R_VERSION }}

%arguments
    R_VERSION = 4.4.0

%post
    apt-get -y update
    apt-get -y install jags
    # Install R packages
    Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak")'
    Rscript -e 'pak::pak(c("rjags", "jagsUI", "coda", "EnvStats", "sads"))'
```

If the `Modular.R` script needs to install packages to system locations, you might need to modify it to install to a user-writable location or ensure the container build process has the necessary permissions.

I am currently using VideoMAE-V2, and I see that on unity under the documentations section: https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/datasets/ai/videomae/, it mentions that the dataset is available to use. But I could not find it when I go to /datasets/ai/opengvlab
Could you please let me know if I am missing anything?
I am particularly looking for Kinetics400 dataset.
Thanks in Advance.

#### Q1: Who can I contact regarding increasing storage space for my PI account and the associated costs regarding it?

**Response:**

To request additional storage for your PI account and get information about associated costs, you should email **hpc@umass.edu** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

When contacting them, you'll need to:

1. **Check storage management information** to determine if you can reduce storage use without expansion [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

2. **Determine the specifics** of what you need using the storage flowchart and descriptions - including the amount, duration, and type of storage needed [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

3. **Identify payment information** - If you're requesting storage expansion that requires payment, you'll need to identify the appropriate institution payment method (e.g. speedtype, Chartfield string, etc.) for your payment source and the name and email of the finance representative within your department [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

4. **Ensure proper authorization** - The request must be done by the PI (head) of the research group, or with the PI's consent if you're not the PI [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

The available storage expansion options include PI group work directories (1TB increments), PI group project directories (5TB increments), and NESE Tape archival storage (10TB increments), each with different pricing structures and time intervals [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

Good morning! According to the Unity documentation, scratch space is available to all users without needing to apply for it. Here's what you need to know:

**Scratch Space Availability:**
- Scratch space has a 50TB soft cap and no purchasing is necessary [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- It's managed through Unity's HPC Workspace tool [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)

**How to Create Scratch Space:**
You can create a workspace using the `ws_allocate` command. For example:
```
ws_allocate simple 14
```
This creates a workspace named "simple" for 14 days. The maximum duration for a workspace is 30 days [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

**To Check Your Current Workspaces:**
Use the `ws_list` command to view a list of your existing workspaces along with key information about them [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

**Key Features:**
- Workspaces can be extended up to 5 times (increased from the previous limit of 3) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- You can create shared workspaces for collaboration [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- Email reminders can be set before workspace expiration [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)

Since scratch space is available to all Unity users without application, you can start using it immediately by creating a workspace with the `ws_allocate` command.

### Thread: Upload large pkl files

**Thread Summary:**

- Total Cost: $0.042930
- Average Tokens/Second: 1051.87

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

For uploading really large .pkl files to Unity, the best options are:

**Globus** - This is the recommended method for large file transfers. Globus Connect allows for transfers between Globus collections and is specifically useful for large files [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/). To use Globus, you can go to app.globus.org and select Unity's Globus endpoint using the collection ID: acda5457-9c06-4564-8375-260ba428f22a [[12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/).

**Command line tools (scp/rsync)** - These are also good options for large files. The rsync command is particularly useful for large transfers as it can resume interrupted transfers and only sync changes [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/). You can use:
```bash
# For a single large file
rsync -tlp LARGE_FILE.pkl unity:~
```

**What to avoid:**
- **Unity OnDemand** - This is explicitly noted as unable to transfer large files [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- **FileZilla** - While it can handle files, it's not specifically optimized for very large transfers

**Important note about upload speeds:** The documentation mentions that "uploading files using American residential internet is typically very slow" but "UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve speeds" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/), so your upload speed may vary depending on your location and internet connection.

- Average Tokens/Second: 1694.18

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

However, I can share some general guidance from the documentation about reducing queue times and requesting resources:

**To reduce queue time:**
- Select the least powerful GPU that can run your code [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Use `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to see available GPU resources and tailor your job to use idle resources [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)
- Select less powerful GPUs if possible (e.g. M40, A40, V100, L40S) [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

**For longer jobs:**
- For jobs longer than 2 days, you can specify `-q long` [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- Some partitions have maximum time limits up to 30 days [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/)
- For jobs in preempt partitions that run longer than 2 hours, you can use `--qos=long` to get up to 14 days [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/)

**For priority boost:**
- For jobs shorter than 4 hours, you can boost job priority by adding `--qos=short` [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

The documentation emphasizes that time to solution is the sum of queue time plus execution time, so finding the right balance of resources is important [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

#### Q1: Hi, would it be possible for me to install this program on my work directory and any advice on how to go about it?

**Response:**

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

However, I can provide some general guidance based on the available information about installing software in your work directory:

**General approach for installing software in your work directory:**

1. **Choose the right location**: It's recommended to place software under the PI /work folder so you can share it with other members of your group [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/). Installing in /home is possible but has a much smaller quota [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/).

2. **Specify installation prefix**: For C/C++ and Fortran projects, you can specify the destination directory using:
   - For CMake projects: `cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/work/...` [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/)
   - For configure-based projects: `./configure --prefix=/work/...` [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/)

3. **Alternative installation methods**: You might also consider using Conda environments, which allow users to compile software easily without administrator privileges [[15]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/).

For specific guidance about installing your particular program, please contact the help desk with details about the software you're trying to install.

#### Q2: Can I get the GUI to show up on the cluster?

**Response:**

Unity provides several graphical interface options for users who need GUI applications:

## Unity OnDemand - Primary GUI Solution

Unity OnDemand is the primary way to access graphical applications without needing X11 forwarding. It provides a web-based interface that can replace your terminal, FTP client, and JupyterHub [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/ondemand/).

### Available GUI Applications

Unity OnDemand offers several graphical applications through its Batch Connect feature [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/):

- **Virtual Desktop Environment**: A general-purpose interactive desktop environment (XFCE)
- **JupyterLab**: Web-based interactive computational environment [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/jupyterlab-ondemand/)
- **RStudio**: IDE for R statistical computing [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)
- **Matlab**: Mathematical computing environment
- **Mathematica**: Computational software
- **VSCode**: Visual Studio Code editor

### How Batch Connect Works

Batch Connect starts your software as a batch job, then connects you to your software through a VNC server. This approach is much faster and easier than traditional X11 forwarding [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/).

### Accessing Unity OnDemand

Unity OnDemand allows you to sign in through your browser using your organization's identity provider, eliminating the need to install SSH clients, configure SSH, or set up public/private keys [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/ondemand/).

## X11 Forwarding Alternative

While X11 forwarding is mentioned as a traditional method, Unity OnDemand's Batch Connect system can run anything that you could have run with X11 forwarding, but with better performance and ease of use [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/).

For accessing Unity OnDemand, simply log in through your web browser at the Unity OnDemand portal using your institutional credentials.
