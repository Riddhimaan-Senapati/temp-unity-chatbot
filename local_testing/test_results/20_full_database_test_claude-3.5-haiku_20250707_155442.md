#### Q2: Is Unity Team able to detect these errors automatically, or shall I report all errors I encounter?

**Response:**

I apologize, but I cannot find specific information in the provided context about a Unity HPC GPU failure detection reporting protocol or detailed SLURM node error handling. 

The context provides general information about GPU resources and job scheduling, but does not cover specific failure detection or error handling protocols. For the most accurate and detailed information about such a technical procedure, I recommend:

1. Reaching out directly to the Unity help desk at [hpc@umass.edu]
2. Visiting the community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/]

For context, the sources do include some related information about GPU and node monitoring:
- There are helper scripts like `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/) that can show GPU allocation and usage
- Users can monitor resource utilization using tools like `seff <job_id>` [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- For running jobs, there are monitoring tools like `htop` and `nvidia-smi` to check CPU, memory, and GPU loads [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

But these are general monitoring tools, not a specific failure detection protocol.

#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

Based on the context provided, here are some steps to help resolve the CUDA_HOME not existing error:

1. Load CUDA Module:
When working with GPUs on Unity, you should first load the CUDA module before running your job. You can do this in your batch script using:

```bash
module load cuda/latest
```

[[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) recommends checking cuda compatibility with your software. You can list available CUDA versions using:

```bash
module spider cuda
```

2. Check Module Compatibility:
[[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) emphasizes the importance of checking which CUDA versions are compatible with the software you're using.

3. GPU Environment Setup:
If you're working with specific frameworks like TensorFlow, you might need to set up a specialized environment. [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) provides an example of setting up a TensorFlow GPU environment:

```bash
module load conda/latest
module load cuda/12.6
module load cudnn/8.9.7.29-12-cuda12.6
```

4. Additional Troubleshooting:
If you continue to experience issues, you can use the following commands to diagnose GPU-related problems:
- `nvidia-smi -L` to find out which GPU is being used
- `nvidia-smi pmon` to view ongoing GPU processes

5. GPU Job Submission:
Ensure you're submitting to a GPU partition. Example batch script [[Source 4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1
module load cuda/latest
# Your job commands here
```

If you need further assistance, I recommend reaching out to the help desk at hpc@umass.edu or visiting the Unity community page for more specific troubleshooting.

#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

To load the CUDA module in a SLURM sbatch script for a GPU job, you can use the `module load` command within your batch script. Based on the provided context [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/), here's an example of how to do this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt  # GPU partition
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00    # Job time limit
#SBATCH --gpus=1       # Request 1 GPU

# Load the CUDA module
module load cuda

# Verify the CUDA version (optional)
nvcc --version

# Your GPU-accelerated application command goes here
./your_gpu_application
```

A few important notes from the context:
- Be sure to check which version of CUDA is compatible with your software [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- You can list available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)
- Ensure your software actually supports GPU use before requesting GPU resources [[15]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

For more specific CUDA version selection, you might want to use a specific version like `module load cuda/11.8` as shown in an example in the context [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

Based on the context provided [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/), here are some strategies to address your Out of Memory (OOM) error:

1. Reduce Batch Size:
For machine learning models running out of memory, try reducing the batch size [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). This is often the most straightforward way to decrease memory usage.

2. Memory Management Suggestions:
- Consider setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` as suggested in the error message to potentially reduce memory fragmentation.
- Optimize your data management and ensure efficient memory usage [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

3. GPU Selection:
If you consistently run into memory issues, you might want to request a GPU with more VRAM. On Unity, you have several GPU options with different memory capacities [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/):
- NVIDIA A40: 48 GB VRAM
- NVIDIA A100: 80 GB VRAM
- NVIDIA L40S: 48 GB VRAM

4. Monitoring Tools:
To help diagnose GPU memory usage, you can use:
- `nvidia-smi`: View ongoing GPU processes
- `nvitop`: Provides an interactive view of NVIDIA GPU processes [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

You can install nvitop via: `pip install nvitop`

Would you like help selecting a more appropriate GPU or implementing any of these memory reduction strategies?

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, I can offer some guidance on managing GPU resource requests and job scheduling:

1. GPU Resource Considerations:
[[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) recommends that you:
- Select less powerful GPUs if possible
- Conduct a scaling analysis to determine the optimal GPU resources
- Be prepared for jobs with large GPU memory requirements to spend time in the queue

2. Partition Selection:
[[Source 13]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/) suggests different partitions based on job duration:
- For jobs less than 2 hours: Use `gpu-preempt`
- For jobs up to 48 hours: Use `gpu`
- For jobs over 48 hours: Specify `--qos=long`

3. Resource Allocation Tips:
[[Source 16]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/) notes there's a limit of 64 GPUs shared by users in a lab group.

4. Checking Resource Usage:
You can use helper scripts to understand current resource availability:
- `unity-slurm-gpu-usage`: Shows GPU allocation across different models
- `unity-slurm-partition-usage`: Shows idle GPUs and cores in different partitions

Recommendations:
1. Check if you can reduce memory requirements
2. Consider using multiple smaller GPU jobs instead of one large job
3. Use the helper scripts to understand current resource constraints

For personalized assistance, I recommend reaching out to the Unity help desk at hpc@umass.edu or consulting the community page at https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/ with your specific batch script for more targeted advice.

#### Q2: What difference is it to use a model that exists locally rather than use one that's online? It must be quicker to run, correct?

**Response:**

I apologize, but I cannot find specific information in the provided context about comparing local versus online machine learning model performance benefits on Unity HPC. While the context contains extensive details about Unity's computational resources, GPU capabilities, and general HPC infrastructure, there isn't a direct discussion about machine learning model performance comparisons.

If you're interested in understanding how to use machine learning resources on Unity, I recommend:

1. Checking the available GPU resources [[19]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/), which include multiple GPU types like:
- NVIDIA A100 (40GB and 80GB VRAM)
- NVIDIA V100
- NVIDIA L40S
- NVIDIA A16

2. Consulting the Unity facilitation team for specific machine learning performance guidance. As noted in the documentation [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/about/), "The facilitation team assists Unity users with deploying their workloads onto Unity and advising on workflow optimization, software tuning, and technical issues."

For a detailed consultation about machine learning model performance, I recommend:
- Emailing hpc@umass.edu
- Joining the Unity User Community Slack
- Consulting with the research computing facilitators directly

Would you like me to help you find more specific resources about machine learning on Unity?

- Total Cost: $0.050682
- Average Tokens/Second: 1108.09

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

I can help you check your disk usage quota on Unity. Here are several methods you can use:

1. Check Quota Usage with df Command
You can use the `df` command to check the free space in your home directory:
```
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you:
- Total size of your home directory
- Used space
- Available space
- Percentage of space used [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

2. Check Specific Directory Usage with du Command
To see which files/directories are consuming space, use the `du` command:
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This will recursively show the size of files/subdirectories in your .cache directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

3. Interactive Directory Tree Exploration
For an interactive view of your disk usage, use the `ncdu` command:
```
$ ncdu
```
This will provide a navigable interface showing disk usage by directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

If you find you're near or over quota, here are some quick tips:
- Delete files in `~/.cache`
- Move files to `/work` or `/project` directories
- Compress large directories
- Delete unnecessary files

Remember, your home directory has a default quota of 50GB [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

Would you like help interpreting the results or reducing your disk usage?

#### Q2: Is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, here are the key details about checking disk quotas and managing storage on Unity:

Checking Disk Quota Usage:
1. Use the `df` (disk free) command to check free space under your quota:
```
$ df -h ~
```
This will show you the filesystem size, used space, available space, and usage percentage [[Source 1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

2. To check which files are using up space, use the `du` (disk usage) command:
```
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This recursively explores directories and shows how much space each file/directory is taking [[Source 1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

3. For an interactive directory tree exploration, use `ncdu`:
```
$ ncdu
```
This provides an interactive interface to navigate and understand your disk usage [[Source 1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

Storage Increase Options:
If you need more storage, here are the steps:
1. First, try to reduce your current storage usage by:
- Deleting unnecessary files (especially in `~/.cache`)
- Compressing directories
- Moving files to `/work` or `/project` directories [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

2. To request additional storage, email hpc@umass.edu. You'll need to:
- Determine the amount and type of storage needed
- If payment is required, provide institution payment method
- Request must be done by the PI or with PI consent [[Source 4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

Storage Types and Quotas:
- `/home`: 50 GB default quota
- `/work`: 1 TB free tier for PI groups
- `/project`: 5 TB free tier (varies by institution)
- Can purchase additional storage in increments [[Source 4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

Common Quota-Filling Causes:
- HuggingFace cache in `~/.cache/huggingface`
- Conda package cache in `~/.conda/pkgs`
- Conda environments in `~/.conda/envs` [[Source 12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

Tip: Consider moving Conda environments and caches to `/work/pi_<your-pi-username>` to free up home directory space.

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

I'll help you find the most relevant information from the provided context for these search queries.

1. "Unity HPC project space allocation timeline storage request"
Based on the context provided, here's the relevant information about project space allocation:

Project directory details:
- Free tier: 5T (quota may vary slightly between URI and UMassD) [[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- Allocation process: 
  - Allocated upon request via a storage form [[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- Purchasing options:
  - Available in 5T increments
  - Can be purchased for 1-year intervals
  - Can purchase up to 5 years at a time [[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

To request project space, the documentation recommends: "To request /project space, email hpc@umass.edu" [[Source 3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

2. "Unity HPC fast large file transfer methods rsync scp"
Multiple file transfer methods are available:

Unity OnDemand file transfer methods:
- Most intuitive interface, but not suitable for large files [[Source 9]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

Command-line transfer methods:
1. SCP (Simple Copy):
   - Part of OpenSSH
   - Simple for straightforward copying
   - Examples:
     ```
     # Single file
     scp FILE_NAME unity:~
     # Entire directory
     scp -r DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
     ```
   [[Source 11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)

2. RSYNC:
   - Better for recurring tasks and network file synchronization
   - Preserves timestamps, links, and permissions
   - Examples:
     ```
     # Single file
     rsync -tlp FILE_NAME unity:~
     # Entire directory
     rsync -rtlp DIRECTORY_NAME unity:~
     ```
   [[Source 11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)

Additional transfer methods:
- FileZilla (requires SSH keys)
- Globus (useful for large transfers between endpoints)
- Command-line tools like scp and rsync [[Source 9]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

Note: Windows users may need to add specific SSH configurations to ensure compatibility [[Source 9, Source 12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)

### Thread: R env

**Thread Summary:**

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the context provided in the documentation, here are a few suggestions for running Modular.R in an Apptainer container:

1. Container Building Context:
When building an Apptainer container, you'll want to ensure the file is accessible within the container. In your definition file, you'll need to use the %files section to copy the Modular.R script into the container [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/):

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:{{ R_VERSION }}
%files
/path/to/Modular.R /opt/Modular.R

%post
Rscript /opt/Modular.R
```

2. Package Installation Considerations:
Since you're trying to install packages, keep in mind a few key points about R package installation in containers:
- Do not use `install.packages()` within scripts run by Slurm [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/)
- Consider using alternative package management tools like `pak`, which can warn you about system dependencies [[9]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/renv/)

3. Permissions and Writing:
The error about `/usr/...` not being writable suggests you'll want to set up a writable location for package installations. In your %post section, you might want to specify a user-writable directory, such as in the user's home directory or a project-specific location.

4. Possible Solution for Running the Script:
```bash
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:4.4.0
%files
/path/to/Modular.R /opt/Modular.R

%post
# Ensure the directory is writable
mkdir -p /home/container/R_libs
export R_LIBS_USER=/home/container/R_libs

# Run the R script
Rscript /opt/Modular.R
```

If you're still experiencing issues with file paths, double-check:
- The absolute path is used
- File permissions are correct
- The file is actually being copied into the container

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

#### Q1: Good afternoon.
I'm having this error on a batch run:
slurmstepd-uri-cpu014: error: execve(): /var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job37168102/slurm_script: Not a directory

**Response:**

I apologize, but I cannot find specific information in the provided context that directly explains this specific Slurm error. 

For the most accurate troubleshooting, I recommend:

1. Reaching out to the Unity HPC help desk at hpc@umass.edu or visiting their community page at https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/ for direct assistance with this specific error.

The error "Not a directory" typically suggests there might be an issue with your batch script's file permissions, formatting, or how it was created/transferred. Some general troubleshooting steps could include:

- Checking the batch script's file permissions (ensure it's executable)
- Verifying the batch script was not corrupted during transfer
- Re-creating the batch script from scratch
- Ensuring the script starts with a proper shebang line (e.g., #!/bin/bash)

But for a definitive diagnosis, contacting the Unity support team would be the most reliable approach.

### Thread: Scratch space

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 1
- Total Response Time: 11.470 seconds
- Average Response Time: 11.470 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.012578
- Average Tokens/Second: 1250.04

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

I'll help you with information about scratch space on Unity based on the provided context.

According to the documentation [[Source 1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/), Unity provides a tool called HPC Workspace that allows you to create and manage high-performance scratch space. Here's how you can create a scratch workspace:

1. Use the `ws_allocate` command to create a workspace
   - The maximum duration for a workspace is 30 days
   - You can create a workspace for a specific number of days (up to 30)

Example of creating a workspace:
```
ws_allocate simple 14
```

Additional details about scratch space from [[Source 2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/):
- There's a 50T soft cap on scratch space
- No purchasing is necessary
- You can refer to the scratch documentation for more details

Some useful features of the HPC Workspace tool include:
- Sending email reminders before workspace expiration
- Creating shared workspaces
- Listing and managing your workspaces

To check your current workspaces, you can use the `ws_list` command.

If you need guidance on using scratch space or have specific requirements, I recommend visiting the Unity scratch space documentation at https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/ or contacting the help desk at hpc@umass.edu.

### Thread: Upload large pkl files

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 1
- Total Response Time: 14.020 seconds
- Average Response Time: 14.020 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.011187
- Average Tokens/Second: 897.86

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, for uploading large files to the Unity filesystem, I recommend using Globus Connect [[12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/). 

Here are a few key points about file transfer methods for large files:

1. Unity recommends several file transfer methods [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/):
   - Unity OnDemand (not recommended for large files)
   - FileZilla
   - Globus
   - Command line tools like scp and rsync

2. For very large files, Globus Connect is specifically recommended. The process involves:
   - Going to app.globus.org
   - Logging in with your university credentials
   - Selecting Unity's Globus endpoint (using the collection ID: acda5457-9c06-4564-8375-260ba428f22a)
   - Selecting your source collection
   - Selecting the .pkl file
   - Pressing "Start" to transfer

3. Additional tips:
   - Be aware that uploading via residential internet is typically very slow [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
   - UMass Amherst has a fiber line directly to MGHPCC to improve transfer speeds

Globus is particularly useful for large file transfers between different collections and provides a reliable method for moving your large .pkl file to the Unity filesystem.

### Thread: Average wait time

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 1
- Total Response Time: 13.360 seconds
- Average Response Time: 13.360 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.018428
- Average Tokens/Second: 1605.01

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

I apologize, but I cannot provide a precise average wait time from the given context. However, I can offer some helpful guidance about job scheduling and time allocation on Unity.

Regarding job time and partitions:

1. Job Time Limitations:
- Most general access partitions have a default time limit of 1 hour [[Source 11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/)
- For jobs longer than 2 days, you can:
  - Specify `-q long`
  - Use partitions with longer maximum time limits (some partitions allow up to 30 days)

2. Extending Job Time:
- For jobs shorter than 4 hours, you can boost job priority by adding `--qos=short` to your job script [[Source 5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- If your job needs to run longer than two hours in a preempt partition, you can use `--qos=long` to get up to 14 days [[Source 11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/)

3. Resource Allocation Recommendations:
- Request the minimum necessary resources to ensure fair access [[Source 4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)
- Use `unity-slurm-partition-usage` to check partition availability [[Source 7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)

For specific wait time details or more personalized guidance, I recommend contacting the Unity help desk at hpc@umass.edu.

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 2
- Total Response Time: 18.970 seconds
- Average Response Time: 9.485 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.022605
- Average Tokens/Second: 1337.11

#### Q1: Hi, would it be possible for me to install this program on my work directory and any advice on how to go about it?

**Response:**

I apologize, but you haven't specified which specific program you want to install. However, I can provide some general guidance about installing software in your work directory on Unity based on the documentation.

[[Source 11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/) recommends placing software under the PI /work folder so that you can share the software with other members of your group. Here are some key steps to install software:

1. Determine the build system:
- Look at the top-level files in the source code
- Different programming languages use different build tools:
  - Java: pom.xml (mvn) or build.xml (ant)
  - Python: environment.yml (conda), requirements.txt (pip), pyproject.toml (poetry)
  - C/C++: CMakeLists.txt (cmake), Makefile (make), configure script

2. Specify the installation location:
- Use commands like these to install to /work:
  - For CMake: `cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/work/...`
  - For configure: `./configure --prefix=/work/...`

3. Build and install the software using appropriate commands for your build system.

[[Source 15]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/) also suggests additional options like:
- Using apt package manager
- Environment modules 
- Conda environments
- Python virtual environments

If you're unsure about installation, you can also [[Source 15]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/) request software installation by completing the Software Request Form in the Unity portal.

Would you like to provide more details about the specific program you want to install?

#### Q2: Can I get the GUI to show up on the cluster?

**Response:**

Based on the provided sources, I cannot find a specific detailed guide about remote desktop GUI display or X11 forwarding for Unity HPC. However, I can provide some related insights:

Connection Methods:
Unity offers multiple ways to access the system's interface:

1. Unity OnDemand [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/)
   - Web-based platform
   - Provides a shell access through browser
   - Most convenient method
   - No SSH or key setup required

2. SSH Connection [[9]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
   - Traditional method for experienced CLI users
   - Connects through terminal

3. Visual Studio Code Remote SSH [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/vscode/)
   - Allows connection using Remote-SSH feature

Recommendation:
For your specific query about remote desktop GUI display and X11 forwarding, I recommend contacting Unity's help desk directly. As stated in multiple sources, for specific questions not covered in documentation, you should email: hpc@umass.edu [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/troubleshooting/)

Would you like me to help you draft an email to their support team about your X11 forwarding question?
