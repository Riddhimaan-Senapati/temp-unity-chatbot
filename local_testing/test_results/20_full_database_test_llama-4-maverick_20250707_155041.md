#### Q1: Could you help me with the error I am getting? (ials-gpu007: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 7: Unknown Error). There is a problem with this GPU too: (ials-gpu008: error: Failed to get device handle for GPU 1: Unknown Error).

**Response:**

To address the error you're encountering, let's break down the information and steps you can take.

1. **Understanding the Error**: The error message "Failed to get device handle for GPU [number]: Unknown Error" typically indicates an issue with accessing or utilizing a specific GPU on the node. This could be due to various reasons such as hardware failure, driver issues, or the GPU being in an unusable state.

2. **Identifying the Nodes and GPUs Involved**: The nodes involved are `ials-gpu007` and `ials-gpu008`. According to the provided context, specifically from Source 13 (https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/nodes/), `ials-gpu[001-014,017-018,020-026,029-033]` are equipped with NVIDIA RTX 2080ti GPUs [[13]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/nodes/). This information suggests that both nodes are part of the same GPU type and partition.


3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - **Check GPU Status**: You can use the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command to check the status of GPUs across the cluster, including the availability and allocation of GPUs on specific nodes [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).
   - **Node and GPU Details**: Review the specifications and status of the nodes `ials-gpu007` and `ials-gpu008` using `unity-slurm-node-usage` to understand their current allocation and usage [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).
   - **Reporting the Issue**: If the GPUs on these nodes are not functioning correctly, it's essential to report the issue to the Unity support team. You can do this by submitting a help request via the Unity User Community #help-desk Slack channel or by emailing `hpc@umass.edu` [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/asking-questions/)[[12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/asking-questions/).


4. **Workaround**: If certain GPUs are not functioning, you can try requesting different GPUs or nodes for your job. You can specify the GPU type or constraint in your Slurm job submission script using the `--constraint` or `--gpus` option [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)[[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q3: Okay, thanks for the info. I got this other error on an A100 node (gpu023) from job 34002652. The script ran fine when I added --exclude gpu023.
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52: UserWarning: CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount(). Did you run some cuda functions before calling NumCudaDevices() that might have already set an error? Error 802: system not yet initialized (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:109.)
  return torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0
...
    assert torch.cuda.is_available()
AssertionError:

**Response:**

To address the issue of a CUDA initialization error when checking if `torch.cuda.is_available()` on the Unity HPC A100 nodes, we need to consider a few potential causes and solutions based on the provided context.

1. **CUDA Compatibility and Availability**: The first step is to ensure that CUDA is properly installed and configured on the system. The A100 nodes are equipped with NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs, which require compatible CUDA versions [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/features/nvlink/).

2. **PyTorch and CUDA Version Compatibility**: PyTorch must be compatible with the CUDA version installed on the system. It's essential to load the appropriate CUDA module or ensure that the PyTorch version is built with the correct CUDA version [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

3. **Environment Setup**: The environment must be correctly set up for PyTorch to use CUDA. This includes loading the necessary modules (e.g., CUDA, cuDNN) and ensuring that the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is set correctly [[6]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

4. **Slurm Configuration**: When running jobs on Unity HPC, Slurm is used for job scheduling. Ensuring that the Slurm script correctly requests GPU resources is crucial. For example, using `--gpus-per-node` or `--gpus` in the Slurm script to specify the number of GPUs required [[16]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

5. **Troubleshooting CUDA Errors**: For CUDA initialization errors, checking the CUDA version and ensuring that the GPU is not being used by another process can help. Tools like `nvidia-smi` can be used to check GPU utilization and `nvitop` can provide more detailed information about GPU usage [[12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Given the specific error `torch.cuda.is_available()`, it's likely related to the PyTorch and CUDA version compatibility or the environment setup. Ensuring that PyTorch is built with the correct CUDA version and that the environment is properly configured for GPU usage is key to resolving this issue.

To directly solve the problem, you can try the following:
- Load the appropriate CUDA module before running your PyTorch script.
- Ensure your PyTorch version is compatible with the CUDA version on the A100 nodes.
- Verify that your Slurm script correctly requests GPU resources.

Here's an example of how to request GPU resources in a Slurm script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00

#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

To resolve the "CUDA_HOME not existing" error when using a GPU in an sbatch job for models, you need to ensure that the CUDA environment is properly loaded.

The error typically occurs because the CUDA environment is not loaded or the `CUDA_HOME` variable is not set correctly. To fix this, you can load the CUDA module in your sbatch script before running your job [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Here's an example of how to do this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1
#SBATCH --mem=8G

module load cuda/12.6
# Your job commands here
```
In this example, `module load cuda/12.6` loads the CUDA module, which sets the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable.

Additionally, you can check the available CUDA versions using `module spider cuda` and load the appropriate version for your job [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

By loading the CUDA module, you should be able to resolve the "CUDA_HOME not existing" error and successfully run your GPU-enabled job.

#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

To load the CUDA module in a SLURM sbatch script, you can use the `module load` command followed by the specific CUDA module you want to use.

For example, if you want to load CUDA version 11.8, you can add the following line to your sbatch script:
```bash
module load cuda/11.8
```
This will load the CUDA module and make it available for use in your job [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

Here's an example of a complete sbatch script that loads CUDA and runs a command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4 # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192 # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1 # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00 # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out # %j = job ID

module load cuda/11.8
nvcc --version
```
In this example, the `module load cuda/11.8` command loads the CUDA module, and the `nvcc --version` command verifies that the module is loaded correctly [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

To follow best practices when using `module load` in an `sbatch` script on Unity HPC, it's essential to understand how environment modules work and how to effectively utilize them in your batch scripts.

1. **Purging Modules**: Before loading any modules, it's a good practice to purge all currently active modules using `module purge`. This ensures that your job doesn't inherit any unexpected modules from your login session, which could potentially cause conflicts or unexpected behavior [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/modules/module-usage/).

2. **Loading Modules**: After purging, you can load the required modules for your job using the `module load` command. For example, if your job requires the CUDA module, you can load it by specifying the version, such as `module load cuda/11.8` [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/modules/module-usage/).

3. **Example from Context**: An example batch script that demonstrates loading modules is provided in Source 1. It shows a simple batch script that loads the `cuda/11.8` module and then checks the CUDA version using `nvcc --version` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

4. **Best Practice Example**: A best practice would be to start your batch script with `module purge` followed by the necessary `module load` commands. For instance:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH -c 4 # Number of Cores per Task
   #SBATCH --mem=8192 # Requested Memory
   #SBATCH -p gpu # Partition
   #SBATCH -G 1 # Number of GPUs
   #SBATCH -t 01:00:00 # Job time limit
   #SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out # %j = job ID

   module purge
   module load cuda/11.8
   nvcc --version
   ```

By following these steps and examples, you can ensure that your `sbatch` scripts are well-structured and less prone to module-related issues on Unity HPC.

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

The error you're encountering, `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory`, indicates that your GPU is running out of memory. This issue can be addressed in several ways based on the information provided in the context.

1. **Reducing Batch Size**: One common solution for machine learning models is to reduce the batch size. This decreases the amount of memory required for each iteration [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

2. **Optimizing Data Management**: Ensure your data management is optimized to reduce memory usage. This might involve more efficient data loading, preprocessing, or using more memory-efficient data structures [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

3. **Using a GPU with More VRAM**: If reducing the batch size or optimizing data management isn't feasible, consider using a GPU with more available VRAM. You can request a different GPU type using the `--constraint` flag with Slurm or by specifying the GPU type in your job submission script [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

4. **Setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`**: As suggested by the error message, setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` can help avoid fragmentation issues when there's a large amount of reserved but unallocated memory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

To implement these solutions, you can:
- Modify your code to reduce the batch size or optimize data loading.
- Adjust your job submission script to request a GPU with more VRAM. For example, you can use `--constraint` to specify a GPU model with sufficient VRAM [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).
- Set the `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` environment variable in your job submission script before running your PyTorch application.

Example of adjusting the job submission script to request a specific GPU:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -p gpu-preempt
#SBATCH -t 02:00:00
#SBATCH --gpus=1
#SBATCH --constraint=2080ti # Request a GPU with sufficient VRAM
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True
./your_pytorch_script.sh
```

   - The error messages you're seeing, such as `slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get usage(15): GPU is lost` and `slurmstepd-gypsum-gpu182: error: NVML: Failed to get Compute running process count(15): GPU is lost`, indicate that there's an issue with the GPU on the node `gypsum-gpu182`. Specifically, Slurm is reporting that it cannot interact with the GPU because it is "lost". This typically suggests a hardware or driver issue with the GPU [[7]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/monitoring/).

2. **Unable to Cancel the Job:**
   - You're unable to cancel the job with ID `30185792`. To cancel a job in Slurm, you typically use the `scancel` command followed by the job ID. So, you should try running:
     ```
     scancel 30185792
     ```
     If this doesn't work, it might indicate a problem with the job's state or an issue with Slurm's ability to manage the job [[10]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/).

3. **Troubleshooting Steps:**
   - **Check Job Status:** First, check the status of your job using `squeue -j 30185792` to understand its current state.
   - **Try Canceling Again:** If the job is still pending or running, try canceling it again with `scancel 30185792`.
   - **Contact Support:** If you're still having trouble canceling the job or if you need further assistance, you can reach out to the Unity help desk at `hpc@umass.edu` or visit their community page for more resources [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/troubleshooting/).

4. **GPU Issues:**
   - The GPU errors you're seeing might require administrative attention. If the issue persists, it may be worth reporting to the Unity support team so they can investigate the GPU hardware or driver issues on `gypsum-gpu182`.

By following these steps, you should be able to either resolve or get assistance with your issue.

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

To address your issue, let's break down the information provided and the context.

You're trying to run the llama3 70b model, which requires a significant amount of GPU memory (500G). You're experiencing long wait times for your jobs to start.

1. **Understanding Your Requirements**: You need a substantial amount of GPU memory for your job. The documentation suggests that you should select a GPU based on the available VRAM [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

2. **Choosing the Right GPU and Partition**: To reduce wait times, it's recommended to select the least powerful GPU that can run your code, based on available GPU memory. However, your requirement is quite high (500G), so you might need a more powerful GPU [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

3. **Partition Selection**: For jobs that require less than 2 hours, using the `gpu-preempt` partition is suggested. However, jobs in this partition can be preempted (terminated and requeued) after 2 hours if higher-priority jobs are submitted [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

4. **Requesting Resources**: You can specify your resource requirements using Slurm directives in your batch script. For example, you can use `--gpus=<type>:<num>` to request a specific type and number of GPUs [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/slurm/).

5. **Interactive Jobs for Testing**: For testing and troubleshooting, you can use `salloc` to start an interactive job. This allows you to make changes and test your code in a single session [[20]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/salloc/).

To potentially reduce wait times, consider the following adjustments:

- **Use `salloc` for Interactive Jobs**: For testing, use `salloc` with appropriate options to request the necessary resources interactively. This can help you troubleshoot and make changes in one session.

Example: `salloc -p gpu-preempt -t 02:00:00 --gpus=a100:1 --mem=500G`

- **Optimize Your Resource Request**: Ensure you're requesting the minimum necessary resources. If your job can run on a less powerful GPU, consider that to potentially reduce wait times.

- **Check Available Resources**: Use helper scripts like `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to check the availability of GPUs and plan your job submissions accordingly [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

- **Consider Priority Partitions**: If you're part of a priority partition, specify it in your job submission to potentially reduce wait times [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

Sharing your batch script could provide more specific insights into how to optimize your job submissions.

- Average Tokens/Second: 6411.89

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

To check your disk quota usage on Unity, you can use the `df` command. The `df` command stands for "disk free" and is used to display information about the available disk space on file systems [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

Here's an example of how to use the `df` command to check your quota usage:
```bash
$ df -h ~
```
This command will display the available space under the quota for your home directory. The output will show the file system, size, used space, available space, and percentage of used space.

For example:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
vast2:/home     50G   29G   22G  58% ~
```
In this example, the home directory has a quota of 50G, with 29G used and 22G available, resulting in 58% usage.

You can also use the `du` command to check which files are taking up space in your directory. The `du` command recursively explores a directory to find out how much space each file within it is taking up [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

For example:
```bash
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```
This command will display the size of each file and directory in the `.cache` directory.

If you want to explore your directory tree through an interactive interface, you can use the `ncdu` command [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

For example:
```
$ ncdu
```
This command will open an interactive interface that allows you to navigate through your directory tree and view the size of each file and directory.

#### Q2: Is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

To request a storage quota increase on Unity, you should first check if you can reduce your storage usage without an expansion by reviewing your storage management [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/). If an increase is still needed, determine the type and amount of storage required using the provided flowchart and storage descriptions [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). Then, email hpc@umass.edu with the necessary details, including the amount, duration, and type of storage needed, as well as the appropriate institution payment method if applicable [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). Ensure that the request is made by the PI or with their consent [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). 

For specific storage options and their purchasing details, you can refer to the storage expansion options table [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). If you're unsure about the process or need further assistance, you can reach out to the help desk at hpc@umass.edu or visit the community page [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q4: Was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

To transfer large files efficiently on Unity HPC, you can use Globus, which is a service that allows for fast and reliable file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

Additionally, Unity OnDemand provides a convenient way to upload and download files from/to your local machine [[15]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/ondemand/).

For command-line transfers, you can use `rsync`, which is useful for recurring tasks and synchronizing files over a network. To use `rsync`, you must install the utility on your Linux or Mac [[17]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

It's also worth noting that UMass Amherst has a fiber line going directly to MGHPCC to improve transfer speeds [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

To address your issue with running the `Modular.R` script within an Apptainer container, let's break down the steps and information provided in the context.

### Understanding the Problem
1. **Loading R Module and Running Rscript**: You can load the `r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer` module and run `Rscript /path/to/Modular.R`. However, the script fails because it tries to write to a non-writable location (`/usr/...`).
2. **Running Rscript within a .def File**: When you try to run `Rscript /path/to/Modular.R` within an Apptainer definition file (.def), you encounter a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error, despite the path being correct.


### Solution
The issue lies in how Apptainer handles files and directories during the build process. When you specify a command to run in the `%post` section of the .def file, the container's filesystem is not yet fully set up or mounted as it would be when running the container. Thus, the file `Modular.R` is not accessible at the specified path during the build process.

To fix this, you should ensure that `Modular.R` is available within the container during the build process. You can achieve this by copying `Modular.R` into the container during the build process using the `%files` section of the .def file [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/).

Here's an example of how you might modify your .def file:

```dockerfile
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:4.4.0

%files
/path/to/Modular.R /opt/Modular.R

%post
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install jags
Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak")'
Rscript -e 'pak::pak(c("rjags", "jagsUI", "coda", "EnvStats", "sads"))'
Rscript /opt/Modular.R
```

In this example, `/path/to/Modular.R` is the path to `Modular.R` on your host system, and `/opt/Modular.R` is where it will be copied to within the container. Then, in the `%post` section, you can run `Rscript /opt/Modular.R`.

Make sure to adjust the paths as necessary to fit your specific use case.

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for about making the script work with the current working directory isn't available in the provided documents.

#### Q1: Good afternoon.
I'm having this error on a batch run:
slurmstepd-uri-cpu014: error: execve(): /var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job37168102/slurm_script: Not a directory

**Response:**

To address the error you're encountering, let's break down the information provided and the context.

The error message `slurmstepd-uri-cpu014: error: execve(): /var/spool/slurm/slurmd/job37168102/slurm_script: Not a directory` suggests that Slurm is trying to execute a file named `slurm_script` within a specific job directory, but it's encountering an issue because the path is not a directory [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

1. **Understanding the Error**: The error indicates that the `slurm_script` is not being recognized as an executable or the path to it is incorrect. This could be due to several reasons such as incorrect shebang (`#!/bin/bash` or similar), wrong file permissions, or the file being corrupted.

2. **Checking the Batch Script**: Ensure your batch script is correctly formatted and has the proper shebang at the top. For a bash script, this should be `#!/bin/bash`.

3. **File Permissions**: Verify that the batch script has execute permissions. You can add execute permissions with the command `chmod +x your_batch_script.sh`.

4. **Contextual Clues**: The error doesn't directly point to a specific solution within the provided context, but it implies an issue with how the batch script is being executed or referenced.

Given the information and the context provided, the most appropriate next step would be to check the batch script's integrity and its execution permissions.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to check the documentation or contact support for further assistance: 'I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents.

### Thread: Upload large pkl files

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 1
- Total Response Time: 2.410 seconds
- Average Response Time: 2.410 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.003073
- Average Tokens/Second: 4758.09

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

To upload a really large `.pkl` file, you have several options available on Unity. The most suitable method depends on your specific needs and preferences.

1. **Globus**: For large file transfers, Globus is recommended. It is useful for transferring large files between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

2. **FileZilla**: Although FileZilla is mentioned as an option for uploading files, it is noted that it requires setting up SSH keys. It's suitable for those familiar with the software [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

3. **Command Line Tools (rsync or scp)**: You can use command-line tools like `scp` or `rsync` for uploading files. `rsync` is particularly useful for recurring tasks and synchronizing files over a network. For `rsync`, you need to install it on your Linux or Mac [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)[[20]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/).

4. **Unity OnDemand**: While Unity OnDemand provides a user-friendly interface for managing files, it is noted that it is not ideal for transferring large files [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

Given the size of your file, **Globus** is likely the best option as it is specifically highlighted for large file transfers [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/). You can follow the instructions for using Globus Connect to transfer your large `.pkl` file [[12]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/globus/).

I'm sorry, but the specific details on using Globus or other methods for your exact file type aren't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

### Thread: Average wait time

**Thread Summary:**
- Queries: 1
- Total Response Time: 2.970 seconds
- Average Response Time: 2.970 seconds
- Total Cost: $0.004635
- Average Tokens/Second: 6089.56

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

To determine the average wait time for a job with 500G of RAM and 4 GPU cores for 1 hour, we need to consider the available resources and the job scheduler's configuration on the Unity cluster.

First, let's examine the available GPU resources and their configurations. According to Source 8 and Source 9, the Unity cluster has various GPU nodes with different specifications. For example, some nodes have NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPUs with 80 GB VRAM, while others have NVIDIA Ada Lovelace L40S GPUs with 48 GB VRAM [[8]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/gpu_summary/)[[9]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/nodes/).


To request more time for your job, you can consider the following options:

1.  **Choose a different partition**: Unity has various partitions with different time limits. For example, the `long` QoS allows jobs to run for up to 14 days [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/).
2.  **Use the `--qos=long` option**: Adding this option to your job submission script can allow your job to run for a longer time, up to 14 days [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/).
3.  **Optimize your job**: Reducing the resources required by your job or optimizing its performance can help reduce the wait time [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

However, I'm sorry, but the specific information about average wait times for jobs with 500G of RAM and 4 GPU cores for 1 hour isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

#### Q1: Hi, would it be possible for me to install this program on my work directory and any advice on how to go about it?

**Response:**

To install a program on your work directory, you can build the software from scratch and specify the installation location. It's recommended to place the software under the PI /work folder so that you can share it with other members of your group [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/).

Here are the general steps to follow:

1.  Obtain the code: Download the compressed release bundle or checkout the tagged version from the Git repository.
2.  Identify the build system: Look at the files at the top level of the code to determine the build system used.
3.  Specify the installation location: Use the build system's commands to specify the installation location, such as `cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/work/...` for CMake or `./configure --prefix=/work/...` for configure [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/).


For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on building software from scratch on Unity [[11]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/softwarefromscratch/).

I'm sorry, but the specific information on installing the particular program you're asking about isn't available in the provided documents.

#### Q2: Can I get the GUI to show up on the cluster?

**Response:**

To run GUI applications on the Unity HPC cluster, you can utilize Unity OnDemand, which provides Batch Connect as a way to run graphical applications. Batch Connect starts your software as a batch job and then connects you to your software through a VNC server [[16]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand).

Here's a step-by-step guide to running GUI applications using Unity OnDemand:
1. **Access Unity OnDemand**: Go to Unity OnDemand and sign in.
2. **Navigate to Interactive Apps**: From the top menu, click "Interactive Apps".
3. **Select the Desired Application**: Choose the GUI application you want to run, such as RStudio, JupyterLab, or Virtual Desktop.
4. **Configure Resources**: Fill in the required fields to allocate resources for your interactive session, such as partition, maximum job duration, memory, and GPU count.
5. **Launch the Application**: Click "Launch" to start the application.
6. **Connect to the Application**: Once the job is running, click "Connect to [Application Name]" to access the GUI application.


Some examples of GUI applications available on Unity OnDemand include:
- **RStudio**: An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R [[14]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/).
- **JupyterLab**: A web-based interactive computational environment for Jupyter notebooks [[17]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand/jupyterlab-ondemand/).
- **Virtual Desktop**: A general-purpose interactive desktop environment.


By following these steps, you can effectively run GUI applications on the Unity HPC cluster using Unity OnDemand.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the Unity documentation on using Batch Connect [[16]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/ondemand).
