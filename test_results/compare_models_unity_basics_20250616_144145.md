#### Q1: What is the Unity HPC?

**Response:**

Unity is a collaborative, multi-institutional high-performance computing platform located at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/), [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/). Unity is under active development and supports primarily research activities [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/), [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/).

The partnering institutions currently include UMass Amherst, University of Rhode Island, UMass Dartmouth, UMass Lowell, UMass Boston, and Mount Holyoke College [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/), [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/).

As of late 2024, Unity is an over 25,000 core cluster based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Slurm with a heterogeneous network containing ethernet and IB linked compute nodes [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/). Unity hosts a variety of compute node architectures, with the majority being Intel or AMD x86-64 nodes, plus a small number of ARM and Power9 nodes. Additionally, Unity contains approximately 1,300 Nvidia GPUs, including over 100 A100, L40S, and V100 GPUs [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/).

For storage, Unity contains 1.5 PB high performance VAST for home, work, and scratch directories, and 2 PB storage from the New England Storage Exchange (NESE), a regionally managed Ceph cluster located at the same data center [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/about/).

#### Q2: How do I access Unity?

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, there are multiple ways to connect to and access Unity [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/):

**Unity OnDemand (Recommended):**
Unity OnDemand is the simplest and most convenient method of connecting because it allows you to login through your browser [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/). You can sign in using your organization's identity provider without needing to install SSH, configure SSH, or set up any public and private keys [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/).

To access the Unity login shell via OnDemand:
1. Login to Unity OnDemand with your organization's identity provider
2. From the top menu, click "Shell"
3. In the dropdown menu that appears, click "Unity Shell Access" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/)

**Other Connection Methods:**
- **SSH Connection** - the most traditional method of connecting to Unity, especially for experienced Command Line Interface (CLI) users, allowing you to connect to Unity in your terminal [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **Visual Studio Code Desktop** - allows you to connect to Unity using the Remote-SSH feature, useful for users that prefer to use VS Code as their editor [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **PuTTY** - a convenient way to connect to Unity that is available to Windows users [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)

Unity provides both graphical and command-line methods for connecting to login and compute nodes [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/).

#### Q2: How do I access Unity?

**Response:**

To access Unity, you can use multiple methods:

1. **Unity OnDemand**: This is the simplest and most convenient method. You can sign in on your browser using your organization’s identity provider. Here are the steps:
   - Login to Unity OnDemand with your organization’s identity provider.
   - From the top menu, click **Shell**.
   - In the dropdown menu that appears, click **Unity Shell Access**.

2. **SSH Connection**: This is the traditional method, especially for experienced Command Line Interface (CLI) users.
   - Follow the instructions in the SSH Connection guide.

3. **Visual Studio Code Desktop**: If you prefer to use VS Code as your editor, you can connect to Unity using the Remote-SSH feature.

4. **PuTTY**: This is a convenient way to connect to Unity that is available to Windows users. See the SSH Connection guide for instructions on how to connect with PuTTY.
