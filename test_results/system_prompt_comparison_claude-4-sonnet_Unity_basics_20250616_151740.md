#### Q1: How do I access Unity?

**Response:**

There are multiple ways to connect to Unity [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/):

1. **Unity OnDemand** - This is the simplest and most convenient method because it allows you to login through your browser using your organization's identity provider, so you don't need to install SSH, configure SSH, or set up any public and private keys [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/ondemand/).

2. **SSH Connection** - This is the most traditional method of connecting to Unity, especially for experienced Command Line Interface (CLI) users. SSH connection allows you to connect to Unity in your terminal [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/).

3. **Visual Studio Code Desktop** - You can connect to Unity using the Remote-SSH feature, which is useful for users that prefer to use VS Code as their editor [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/).

4. **PuTTY** - This is a convenient way to connect to Unity that is available to Windows users [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/).

The Unity platform provides both graphical and command-line methods for connecting to login and compute nodes [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/connecting/).
