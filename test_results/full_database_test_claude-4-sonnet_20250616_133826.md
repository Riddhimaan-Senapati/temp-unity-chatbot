#### Q3: Okay, thanks for the info. I got this other error on an A100 node (gpu023) from job 34002652. The script ran fine when I added --exclude gpu023.
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:52: UserWarning: CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount(). Did you run some cuda functions before calling NumCudaDevices() that might have already set an error? Error 802: system not yet initialized (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/cuda/CUDAFunctions.cpp:109.)
  return torch._C._cuda_getDeviceCount() > 0
...
    assert torch.cuda.is_available()
AssertionError:

**Response:**

Based on the error message you're encountering, this appears to be a CUDA initialization issue on the specific node gpu023. The error "CUDA initialization: Unexpected error from cudaGetDeviceCount(). Did you run some cuda functions before calling NumCudaDevices() that might have already set an error? Error 802: system not yet initialized" suggests there's a problem with CUDA setup on that particular node.

Since your script runs fine when you exclude gpu023 using `--exclude gpu023`, this indicates the issue is specific to that node rather than your code.

For this type of node-specific hardware or system configuration issue, I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

The support team will be able to investigate the specific hardware or CUDA driver issues on gpu023 and resolve the problem so you won't need to exclude that node in future jobs.

#### Q1: Hi there, I'm getting CUDA_HOME not existing error when utilizing gpu in sbatch for models. Could someone guide me on how best to resolve this issue?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, to resolve CUDA_HOME not existing errors when using GPUs in sbatch jobs, you need to load a CUDA module. 

CUDA is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and a version of CUDA will typically be required to be loaded for most GPU jobs because it allows access to the NVIDIA compiler suite (nvcc, nvfortran) and the NVIDIA GPU profiling tool (nsys) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

To see available CUDA versions, you can use:
```
module spider cuda
```

Be sure to check which version(s) of CUDA are compatible with the software that you are using [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

You would typically add a line like `module load cuda/<version>` to your batch script before running your GPU-enabled code. This should set up the CUDA_HOME environment variable and make the CUDA toolkit available to your application.

#### Q2: How to do load cuda module in my sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, you can load the CUDA module in your sbatch script by adding the `module load` command after your SBATCH parameters and before your main script commands.

Here's how to do it according to the example provided [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4  # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192  # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu  # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1  # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00  # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out  # %j = job ID

module load cuda/11.8
nvcc --version
```

The context shows that you can load a specific version of CUDA (like `cuda/11.8` in the example) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/). 

To see what versions of CUDA are available, you can use the command `module spider cuda` [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

The context also notes that you should check which version(s) of CUDA are compatible with the software you're using [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

#### Q3: Should I add at the start of every sbatch script?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, yes, you should add `#!/bin/bash` at the start of every sbatch script (or whichever interpreter you need). 

The documentation states: "In the first line of the batch script, write the line `#!/bin/bash`, or whichever interpreter you need. If you are unsure of which interpreter to use, use `#!/bin/bash`" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

The example batch script in the documentation also demonstrates this practice:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -c 4  # Number of Cores per Task
#SBATCH --mem=8192  # Requested Memory
#SBATCH -p gpu  # Partition
#SBATCH -G 1  # Number of GPUs
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00  # Job time limit
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out  # %j = job ID
```

This shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) tells the system which interpreter to use when executing your script [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/) [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/sbatch/).

#### Q1: Hi team, I'm getting the following error at some point in my experiments in job 34418381. I'm not sure how to change my configurations to resolve it. Could I get some help with this?
torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 406.38 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.51 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.18 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 219.44 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)

**Response:**

Based on the error you're encountering, this is a common GPU memory issue. The error `torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory` means that your GPU doesn't have enough available VRAM for your current workload [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

Here are the recommended solutions:

**1. Reduce Memory Usage:**
For machine learning models running out of memory, try reducing the batch size or ensuring your data management is optimized [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

**2. Use a GPU with More VRAM:**
You may need a GPU with more available VRAM [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). You can check available GPU types and their VRAM using the `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` command [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/). From the available options, you could consider:
- A100 GPUs (80GB or 40GB VRAM)
- L40S GPUs (48GB VRAM)
- A40 GPUs (48GB VRAM)
- RTX8000 GPUs (48GB VRAM)

**3. Monitor GPU Usage:**
You can monitor your GPU memory usage using `nvidia-smi` or `nvitop` to better understand your memory consumption patterns [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/) [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

**4. Follow PyTorch's Memory Management Suggestions:**
As mentioned in your error message, you could also try setting `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to avoid memory fragmentation, as suggested in the PyTorch documentation.

To request a different GPU type for your next job, you can specify the GPU type in your Slurm submission (e.g., `--constraint=a100` or `--constraint=l40s`).

#### Q1: Good evening,
I'm having issues figuring out how I can acquire resources for my test runs.
I'm trying to run the llama3 70b model that we have locally. I believe that I need 500G of memory on GPU for that job but every time I attempt to run a job with these requests it goes pending for such a long time. I need to run multiple runs in one session to be able to troubleshoot my code and make changes in one working session.
Is there a chance that I can fix my request somehow to get quicker results? Or is that just how it goes when using this much resources.
I don't mind sharing the batch script I'm running if that might help.

**Response:**

Based on the provided documentation, I can help you understand why your jobs are spending a long time in the queue and suggest some strategies to get faster results.

## Why Your Jobs Are Pending

The documentation explains that **large VRAM GPUs are often in high demand** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). Your request for 500GB of GPU memory is quite substantial, and according to the GPU usage information, the highest VRAM available appears to be 80GB on GH200 and A100 GPUs [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

## Strategies to Reduce Queue Time

### 1. Choose the Right Partition
For your testing and troubleshooting needs, consider using the **gpu-preempt partition** for jobs under 2 hours [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). The documentation recommends:
- **Jobs that require less than 2 hours**: gpu-preempt, priority partitions
- **Use checkpointing in the gpu-preempt partition if your job needs more than 2 hours** [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/)

### 2. Select Appropriate GPU Types
The documentation strongly advises to **select the least powerful GPU that can run your code** to reduce queue time [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/). You can:

- Use `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to check current GPU availability [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/)
- **Select less powerful GPUs if possible (e.g. M40, A40, V100, L40S)** [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/)

### 3. Use Constraints Effectively
You can specify multiple GPU options using constraints:
```bash
#SBATCH --constraint=2080ti|1080ti|2080
```
This allows Slurm to use any of these GPU types that become available first [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/gpus/).

### 4. Request Minimum Necessary Resources
The documentation emphasizes to **request the minimum necessary resources to avoid wasting compute power and ensure fair access for all users** [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/get-started/quickstart/).

## Reality Check on Resource Requirements

Based on the GPU information shown, it appears that 500GB of GPU memory may not be available as a single allocation on Unity. The largest VRAM shown is 80GB on GH200 GPUs [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/). You may need to reconsider your approach or use model parallelism across multiple GPUs.

I'd be happy to help you optimize your batch script if you'd like to share it, keeping in mind the resource constraints and recommendations above.

#### Q1: I am trying to check my disk usage quota - but dont know if its full

**Response:**

To check your disk usage quota on Unity, you can use the `df` (disk free) command to see how much space you're using and how much is available [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

Here's how to check your quota usage:

```bash
$ df -h ~
```

This will show you output similar to:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% File
vast2:/home      50G   29G   22G  58% ~
```

The output shows:
- **Size**: Total quota allocated to you
- **Used**: How much space you're currently using
- **Avail**: How much space is still available
- **Use%**: Percentage of your quota being used [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

If you want to see which specific files are taking up space in your directories, you can use the `du` (disk usage) command:

```bash
$ du -sh ~/.cache/*
```

This will show you the size of each subdirectory or file [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

For an interactive way to explore your directory usage, you can use the `ncdu` command, which provides a visual interface to navigate through your directories and see what's using the most space [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

If you find that your quota is exceeded or nearly full, you'll need to either move files to directories with larger quotas (like `/work`), delete unnecessary files, or compress directories to reduce space usage [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

#### Q2: is it possible to add more space to it?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, there are a few ways to manage space:

**For HPC Workspace (scratch space):**
You can extend a workspace for additional time (up to 30 days maximum duration), but the context doesn't specifically mention increasing the storage capacity of an existing workspace [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/) [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

**For general storage expansion:**
To explore storage expansion options, PIs can email hpc@umass.edu [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

**Alternative approaches mentioned in the context:**
- You can create additional workspaces using `ws_allocate` [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- You can compress directories to save space using the `zip` command [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)
- You can create temporary scratch space for jobs [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/)

If you need more specific information about increasing storage capacity for existing workspaces, I'd recommend contacting hpc@umass.edu as mentioned in the storage expansion guidance.

#### Q3: whats the timeline on project space?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, PI group project directories have the following timeline options [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/):

- **Free tier**: 5T allocated upon request via the storage form
- **Purchasing**: Available in 5T increments on 1 year intervals, up to 5 years at a time

So you can purchase project space for up to 5 years at a time, with the purchasing done in 1-year intervals.

#### Q4: was just wondering if there was a faster way to move large files? than just using mv?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, for moving large files on Unity, you should consider these approaches:

**For file transfers to/from Unity:**
- **Globus** is specifically mentioned as "useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect" [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/)
- **rsync** is noted as a good command-line tool for file operations and can preserve timestamps, links, and permissions with flags like `-tlp` [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/cli/)

**Important performance consideration:**
The documentation warns that "Our VAST storage can be slow when it comes to handling large numbers of small files. Consider using tmux or a batch job for large I/O operations" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

**For moving files between directories on Unity:**
If you're moving files to manage disk quotas, consider moving files from your home directory to `/work` directory, as "quotas on /work are much larger than on /home, and quotas on /project can be much larger than on /work" [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/quotas/).

For more specific guidance on optimizing large file transfers beyond what's covered in these documents, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

#### Q1: Hi all! Hopefully an easy question - I'm trying to help someone install some R software in an apptainer container. Their software comes with a file called Modular.R that should install everything it needs. I'm not sure yet if this will play nicely with apptainer (optimistic), but so far I can't even figure out how to run it.

If I load the r-rocker-ml-verse/4.4.0+apptainer module and then run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" it will run, but Modular.R will fail because /usr/... of course isn't writable. When I try to run "Rscript /path/to/Modular.R" within a .def file, however, it gives me a "cannot open file 'Modular.R': No such file or directory" error. I can copy the exact path from the error message and it opens the correct file, so the path is specified correctly. What am I doing wrong here?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, the issue you're encountering appears to be related to file path access within the Apptainer container build process. When you're building a container using a `.def` file, the build environment is isolated and may not have access to files on your host system in the same way.

From the context provided, I can see an example of building an R container with external dependencies [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/software/). The example shows:

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: rocker/ml-verse:{{ R_VERSION }}

%arguments
R_VERSION = 4.4.0

%post
apt-get -y update
apt-get -y install jags
# Install R packages
Rscript -e 'install.packages("pak")'
Rscript -e 'pak::pak(c("rjags", "jagsUI", "coda", "EnvStats", "sads"))'
```

Notice that in the `%post` section, the R package installation is done using inline R commands (`Rscript -e`) rather than calling external R script files.

For your situation, you would likely need to either:
1. Copy the `Modular.R` file into the container during the build process
2. Include the contents of `Modular.R` directly in the `%post` section using `Rscript -e` commands

However, I'm sorry, but the specific information about how to properly handle external R script files during Apptainer container builds isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance with this specific container building issue, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

#### Q1: Who can I contact regarding increasing storage space for my PI account and the associated costs regarding it?

**Response:**

To request additional storage space for your PI account and get information about associated costs, you should email hpc@umass.edu [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/). 

Important requirements for storage requests:
- If you're not the PI (head) of your research group, the request must be done by your PI or with your PI's consent [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- If you're requesting a storage expansion that requires payment, you'll need to identify the appropriate institution payment method (e.g. speedtype, Chartfield string, etc) for your payment source and the name and email of the finance representative within your department [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)

The documentation also recommends checking out their storage management information to determine if you can reduce storage use without storage expansion, and using their flowchart to determine the amount, duration, and type of storage needed [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

#### Q1: Good morning, How do I know if I have scratch space or apply for some?

**Response:**

Good morning! Based on the provided documentation, Unity provides 50TB of scratch space with a soft cap, and no purchasing is necessary [[3]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/).

To use scratch space on Unity, you need to create a workspace using the HPC Workspace tool. Here's how:

**To create a scratch workspace:**
Use the `ws_allocate` command to create a workspace. For example:
```
ws_allocate simple 14
```
This creates a workspace named "simple" for 14 days (maximum duration is 30 days) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

**To check existing workspaces:**
Use the `ws_list` command to see your current workspaces and their remaining extensions [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/).

**Key points about scratch space:**
- The scratch directories (/scratch) use high performance VAST DataStore storage [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- Scratch directories DO NOT have snapshots, so data cannot be restored if lost [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/storage/)
- You can extend workspaces up to 5 times (increased from 3 extensions) [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)
- Please release workspaces when no longer needed to optimize scratch space for all users [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/hpc-workspace/)

The scratch space is ideal for temporary files during job execution and high-performance I/O operations.

- Average Tokens/Second: 540.14

#### Q1: What is the best way to upload a really large .pkl file?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, for uploading really large files like a .pkl file, **Globus is the best option** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

The context specifically states that "Globus is useful for large file transfers between Globus endpoints, including your personal computer with Globus Connect" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

Additionally, the context mentions that "Unity OnDemand is the most intuitive interface, but can't transfer large files" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/), which rules out that option for your large .pkl file.

The other available methods mentioned are FileZilla and command-line tools like scp and rsync, but Globus is specifically highlighted as the tool designed for large file transfers [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/managing-files/).

#### Q1: Hey, what's the average wait time on 500G of ram 4 GPU cores for 1 hour? Is there anything I can do to be able request more time to be able to work on and test my project?

**Response:**

I'm sorry, but the specific information you're looking for isn't available in the provided documents. For further assistance, you can reach out to our help desk at [hpc@umass.edu] or visit our community page at [https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/contact/community/].

However, I can provide some relevant information from the documentation about GPU resources and time limits:

Based on the helper scripts available, you can check current GPU usage with `unity-slurm-gpu-usage` to see how many GPUs are idle and pending allocation [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/). You can also use `unity-slurm-partition-usage` to see idle resources across different partitions [[4]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/jobs/helper_scripts/).

Regarding time limits, most GPU partitions have a maximum time limit of 2 days with a default of 1 hour [[2]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/). For preempt partitions, jobs can be killed after two hours, but you can use `--qos=long` to get up to 14 days [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/cluster_specs/partitions/).

For specific wait time estimates and strategies to request longer job times for your project, please contact the help desk for personalized assistance.

#### Q2: Can I get the GUI to show up on the cluster?

**Response:**

Based on the provided context, yes, you can access GUI applications on Unity through Unity OnDemand. Unity OnDemand provides a web-based interface that includes several GUI applications [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/):

- **XFCE**: A general purpose interactive desktop environment [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **JupyterLab** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **Matlab** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **RStudio** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)
- **Mathematica** [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/)

Unity OnDemand is described as "the simplest and most convenient method of connecting because it allows you to login through your browser" [[1]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/help/faq/). The XFCE desktop environment would provide you with a full graphical desktop interface that you can access through your web browser.

The context also shows that RStudio, for example, provides a full GUI experience through Unity OnDemand, where you can launch interactive sessions and "Connect to RStudio Server" to access the graphical interface [[5]](https://docs.unity.rc.umass.edu/documentation/tools/r/).
